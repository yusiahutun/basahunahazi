Erik Griffin is a stand-up comedian, writer, and actor who has been making a mark in the entertainment industry with his jokes and videos that compel people to burst into laughter. He has toured the nation performing and headlining the clubs and colleges every weekend. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-172 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Erik’s Beginning in Comedy!!</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The comedy was not always the part of his career, but it was in his genes which compelled him to quit his job to start his journey in comedy. Beginning in 2003, he dedicated full time to it and came to prominence after becoming a part of the Comedy Central.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He appeared in the episodes like Live At Gotham, NBC’s Last Comic Driving and Comics Unleashed. His most recognizable character is that of mustachioed Montez Walker on Workaholics. He has since worked on several TV series like Blunt Talk, One Day At &nbsp;A Time, You’re the Worst and Harvey Breaks. He will appear in Showtime’s dark comedy series; I’m Dying Up Here.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>How Much Is Erik’s Net Worth?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>His career prospect is rich in an experience ranging from stages to television to the main screen. He definitely has earned a fabulous amount of net worth from the prolific career that he is enjoying. He has had several recurring as well as leading characters in various Tv series that has made him a quite well-known personality. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Along with that, he has also worked on the main screen with the movie First Girl I Love. He is a part of different TV series at the time including the Workaholics and is filming Electric Love.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Personal Life and Relationships:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>He has been vocal or to be precise satirical about the relations between different celebrities especially when he feels that there is a mismatch. At a time he has even gone&nbsp;on to say that Jennifer Lawrence was his new girlfriend. Jokes aside, he has his mouth shut his personal life.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187></span><p style=text-align:justify>There have also not been any revelations from his side about the fact that he has married or not or has a girlfriend or wife. Like many other celebrities from the industry, he could be someone who likes to keep his family away from the spotlight and the reach of media.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Since he has been so quiet about his own life, there have also been rumors that he could probably be a gay. It’s not an unusual thing for the people to assume such as they have the habit of calling out celebrities and have done it in the past too. Leaving all the speculations unanswered, he is busy continuing to make people laugh.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Short Bio:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The personal life of this comedian is so secret that his wiki remains largely incomplete and even his age is a mystery. However, his birthday is on 12th&nbsp;March, and he comes from the family with mixed race and backgrounds. His mother is a Central American-Caribbean while his father is of European descent. The American National belongs to mixed ethnicity. He has the height of 6 feet and 4 inches. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2r7HTsKarrJhjsLC5jpycpZ2Sp7a1tcSsZp6qmaB6qL7In52ipl2stqy1jJqenmWdlr%2BztcSdZLChlpp6qLXRpZ2roZWjsW6zwLJkoZ2ZnLW1ec2eq2avn6fBqXrHraSl</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kaitlin-nowak.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kaitlin Nowak Bio, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Wiki">&larr;
