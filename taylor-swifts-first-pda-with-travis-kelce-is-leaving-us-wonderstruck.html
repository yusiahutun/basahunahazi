The first photo of Taylor Swift’s PDA with Travis Kelce is making waves among Swifties – and we’re not mad.</strong></p><p>The rumors of Tay Tay and the NFL star sparked back in July. For the past two months, the <a href=#>celebrity</a> hitmaker has been shipped with the athlete, ever since he attended her Eras Tour. However, the first hopeful meeting between the pair apparently didn’t happen. Kelce told his brother Jason on their podcast that he wanted to meet the <a href=#>music</a> star, but she reportedly didn’t reciprocate the feeling. Something happened since then, as the two have been fueling gossip they’re dating with outfits, bracelets and NFL tickets. Now, we’ve been treated to an adorable photo of Taylor Swift’s and Travis Kelce’s first PDA.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-s-pda-is-enchanting>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s PDA is enchanting</h2><p>A photo of the pair at the Chiefs game after-party is speaking volumes. In the snap, Taylor and Travis are standing close, with the singer’s arm draped around his neck. He’s looking down as the pair are talking to someone else and appear to be in high spirits. It seems Travis’ head is looking down in laughter, and his hand appears to be on her waist – although we’re not entirely sure.</p><p>One thing for certain, they both seem relaxed in the situation and enjoying their time together. There’s no bad blood here.</p><p>The Cruel Summer hitmaker was seen at the Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday to watch Travis and the Chiefs play the Chicago Bears. The sighting of her in his private box sent shockwaves across the Taylor Swift universe. After weeks of speculation, it seems they’re finally confirming things are heating up between them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-timeline>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce timeline</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1690613753-1024x687.jpg><p>If you’re still drawing a blank space over their dating rumors, here’s the run-down for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s timeline before the PDA-filled snap.</p><p>In July, No 87 (Travis) <a href=# rel=nofollow>traveled to see one of her Eras Tour</a> concerts, and hoped he’d meet the star. He had he made a friendship bracelet – cute – to give to her, and it had his number on it. He wasn’t afraid of diving into Swiftie tradition of swapping the friendship bracelets at her gigs, and we’re here for it.</p><p>But he wasn’t the only celeb to go to her gig, her ex-boyfriend <a href=#>Taylor Lautner and his wife</a> enjoyed themselves. Even <a href=#>Meghan Markle was seen dancing </a>at her concert.</p><p>However, he told his brother, Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, it didn’t happen. On their New Heights Podcast on July 26, he explained he took it “personally”.</p><p>“I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs she sings.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-think-it-s-all-100-true>‘I think it’s all 100% true”</h2><p>Fast-forward to September, and Jason is quizzed about his brother’s relationship rumors on the Thursday Night Football postgame show. Tony Gonzalez couldn’t resist popping the question on the September 14 show.</p><p>But Jason, the loyal brother that he is, kept quiet. Mom’s the word.</p><p>He excellently diverted: “I’ve seen these rumors, I cannot comment… I know Travis is having fun, and we’ll see what happens with whoever he ends up with.”</p><p>Thanks Jason.</p><p>But, he was asked again a week later on 94.1 WIP in Philadelphia.</p><p>“I don’t really know what’s happening in Travis’ love life. I try to keep his business kind of his business and stay out of that world,” Jason explained.</p><p>“But having said that, I think he’s doing great and I think that it’s all 100% true.”</p><p>If your head exploded, so did ours. But he then said he was joking – but we don’t think that’s true anymore.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-we-ll-see-what-happens>‘We’ll see what happens’</h2><p>Now we’re at September 21, when Travis on The Pat McAfee Show said he invited the Grammy Award winner to his game. It appears the star wasn’t too upset she didn’t meet him at her show. It came after Taylor Swift’s rumored ex, <a href=#>Matt Healy, was seen making out</a> with someone new.</p><p>“I told her that I’ve seen her rock a stage in Arrowhead and she might have to come see me rock the stage at Arrowhead,” he told the star.</p><p>“We’ll see what happens in the near future.”</p><p>Is he psychic now?</p><p>He’s on the field, and she’s on the bleachers. September 24 happened, and the world imploded. Swift was in his private box sitting beside Travis’ mom, Donna. The 33-year-old was seen cheering during the game and talking with his friends and family.</p><p>After the game, Travis, also 33, was seen <a href=# rel=nofollow>leaving together with Taylor standing side-by-side</a>. Not only that, the NFL star was <a href=# rel=nofollow>wearing a suit</a> inspired by the 1989 Bedroom painting denim jacket.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-drive-out-of-the-city-away-from-the-crowds>Drive out of the city, away from the crowds</h2><p>If the duo walking together after the game isn’t enough, Taylor was seen leaving in Travis’ car. Yep, your eyes are not deceiving you.</p><p>Then on September 27, on the New Heights podcast, Travis gushed over Taylor getting along with his friends and family in his private box.</p><p>His brother Jason knew that they’d likely have a lot more listeners with the hype, so prodded the fellow athlete.</p><p>“I just thought it was awesome how everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her,” Travis smiled.</p><p>“… She looked amazing. Everybody was talking about her in a great light. And on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans.</p><p>And this is where we are now. What we do know, is that it’s new and Delicate. But Swifties are totally here for it.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2eFcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy06xkn6GiqMFuvMOaZLChpJ16tb7Ar6CsZZuauaSxjKKqZqSVlsOqusZmrKxlp6S7pbHRrKurrZOgfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lisa-kerney-bio-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Lisa Kerney Husband?
