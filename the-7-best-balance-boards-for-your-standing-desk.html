Here are the most important features you should consider:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Different Styles:</strong>&nbsp;Surprisingly, there are several unique types of balance boards. You can choose from options like rocker boards, wobble boards, rollers, springs, half balance balls, and even balance pads, you should choose one that matches your agility and experience levels.</li><li><strong><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Should You Use a Balance Board with Your Standing Desk?</a></span>Cost:</strong>&nbsp;Some balance board models run several hundred dollars a pop, but you can find more affordable options between around $30-$60. It really just comes down to your budget, your skill level, and what type of board and materials you want. In most cases, materials don't have much impact on these boards---they just make them look nicer.</li><li><strong>Safety:&nbsp;</strong>We'll be honest with you: it is possible to get injured on these boards if you aren't being careful. However, if you're being even just slightly mindful, you'll probably be just fine. You may want to hold onto a table (or friend) the first few times until your body gets the hang of things but your body will likely adjust to it in no time.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=best-overall-board-fluidstance-plane-cloud>Best Overall Board: Fluidstance Plane Cloud</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/9c79e1b1.png> <a href=#>Fluidstance</a><p>The Fluidstance Plane Cloud balance board offers terrific performance and a stylish design. Plus, it's designed specifically for use at a standing desk, where others often split duties between standing desks and your home gym. The lightweight and compact board is available in four colors: Vapor, Storm, Green Flash, and Stratus.</p><p>It is carefully engineered to offer the perfect balance of stability and movement. This way you'll end up making more micro-movements that'll ultimately help you tone and strengthen your muscles. It also lets you rock, swivel, wobble, and do other movements that lead to a higher calorie burn, an overall increased heart rate, full core engagement, and improved posture. We've reaped the benefits with <a href=#>other boards from Fluidstance</a>, and the Plane Cloud is a comparable pick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fluidstance Level Balance Board Review: Makes My Standing Desk Even Better</a></span></p><p>The Plane has superior grip and rubber bumpers that provide natural stopping points as you move around on it. Plus, the ultra-soft padded top makes it feel more like you're standing on a mat than a board. And while it offers a full range of movement, it's designed to keep the majority of that from the hips down so it won't impact your typing or writing. It's also made of eco-conscious material from sustainable manufacturing, making it the perfect choice for anyone interested in environmentally-friendly purchases.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/51zfh-j2ztl-_sl500_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Fluidstance Plane Cloud</h5><span>Best Overall Board</span><p class=display-card-description>This balance board offers full movement and full core engagement, plus it looks stylish.</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$169 at Amazon</a><h2 id=best-rocker-board-yes4all-pro-rocker>Best Rocker Board: Yes4All Pro Rocker</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/d88a61e0.png> <a href=#>Yes4All</a> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rocker boards are the best option for beginners, as they're the easiest to use and are generally the most affordable.

It's perfect for strengthening muscles, ligaments, tendons, and joints and helping you boost your coordination and balance.</p><p>The 17.5-inch board offers plenty of room to comfortably stand on, and it can support up to 350 pounds. It is designed with an anti-slip base, so you can use it on wood or tile as well as carpet. The deck also has a grippy surface that works with both bare feet and shoes.
