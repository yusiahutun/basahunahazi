Tim Johnson said investigators were interviewing family members and neighbors about the case. When they finished, they planned to present their findings to the district attorney's office.<br></span></p><p><span>Investigators described the pit as 20 feet by 20 feet, with a sloped entrance leading down to the 24-foot bottom. The children were at the bottom of the pit retrieving a child-sized pickaxe when the walls fell in on them. No permits had been issued for Arwood to dig on the site.<br></span></p><p><span>Johnson said investigators still don't know why Arwood was digging the hole and that people have speculated that the pit was everything from a 'doomsday bunker' to an underground structure for 'illegal activity,' such as growing marijuana.</span></p><p><span>Sheriff's deputies on Monday removed guns and a marijuana plant from Arwood's mobile home. Arwood is a felon who is not allowed to have guns. He was convicted in 2003 for possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell.<br></span></p><p><span>Dion Burleson, spokesman for the Denver Fire Department, which responded to collapse, said crews filled in the pit Monday.<br></span></p><p><span>Arwood said he was building a rammed earth home, an ancient building method where dirt is used to shape the foundation. Arwood said he had been digging for three months. He said he was building it for his family's future - to give them a safe, affordable eco-friendly home that would last a generation. And he said there was nothing strange about it and that people have been building rammed earth homes since the beginning of civilization. He said he researched the permits and didn't believe he needed one at that stage of construction.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/04/10/article-2306989-19306A20000005DC-688_634x422.jpg height=422 width=634 alt="Support: Members of the Adventure in Faith Church in Alexis, North Carolina, pray for the family of the two young children" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Support: Members of the Adventure in Faith Church in Alexis, North Carolina, pray for the family of the two young children in April</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/04/10/article-2306989-19301AF8000005DC-1_634x422.jpg height=422 width=634 alt="Relief: Darrell Buchanan, whose wife is related to the family of the two young children, prays with members of the Adventure in Faith Church in Alexis, North Carolina on Monday" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Relief: Darrell Buchanan, whose wife is related to the family of the two young children, prays with members of the Adventure in Faith Church in Alexis, North Carolina in April</p><p><span>He also said he didn't expect the walls to collapse.

Then he punched the soil in frustration.<br></span></p><p><span>Arwood said he never allowed the children in the construction site. But they were children who loved to play in a big backyard, and sometimes they would sneak in and try to help without warning. But when he spotted them, Arwood said he would immediately kick them out.<br></span></p><p><span>As the walls fell in, he recalled, the children were running to get away. He was within inches of grabbing his daughter's hand. But she disappeared under a surge of dirt. Now he's haunted by the memories.</span></p><p><span>'I want to wake up.

She begged me every day afterschool and put on coffee at 4 a.m. to hunt before school. She loved her cammo (camouflage) and providing food for her family, be it gardening farming or hunting,' he said, adding that she could hit milk jugs at 200 yards.
