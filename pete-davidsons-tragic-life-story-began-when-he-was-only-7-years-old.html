Pete Davidson has tried to keep his dad’s memory alive, but admits it has taken its toll when it comes to trying to implement the tragedy into his comedy.</strong></p><p>However, when he is known for his comedy, it’s not always for the reason of making people laugh, but rather for making audiences uncomfortable. Carving a career around bringing <a href=#>TV</a> fans joy is a hard task, but his own life has seen its fair share of tragedy. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> has opened up over the sad ordeal more than once.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-pete-davidson-lost-his-dad-during-the-9-11-attacks>Pete Davidson lost his dad during the 9/11 attacks</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1340137441-1024x683.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star has made numerous jokes about his dad, who was a firefighter, dying in the September 11 attacks in 2001. One example that was a big talking point amongst viewers was when he appeared on a Comedy Central special opposite <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a>.</p><p>Pete Davidson told him: “I always regretted growing up without a dad … until I met your dad, Justin. Now I’m glad mine’s dead.”</p><p>However, he has now said that he wants to distance himself from the 9/11 jokes. The celebrity told&nbsp;Jon Bernthal’s on his Real Ones <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">podcast</a> that being a “big idiot with a d**k that smokes weed” was “humiliating.”</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>Megan Fox’s ‘wildest dating story’ will have MGK on his best behavior</a></strong></p><p>On his silly persona, the 30-year-old said: “That was my thing for a bit. But it doesn’t have to be my thing forever.”</p><p>Joking aside, Pete Davidson of course loved his father and enjoyed the time he spent with his dad.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-two-jokes-in-15-years>“Two jokes in 15 years”</h2><p>Pete went on to explain that he was frustrated with his association with those jokes.</p><p>He said: “It’s like the 9/11 thing. People will be like, ‘Oh, he’s probably just talking about his dead dad all the time,’ and it’s like, Yo, I made two jokes about my dad in a span of like 15 years.”</p><p>Pete said that he hates the “sympathy” that comes when he discusses what happened, too.</p><p>“It makes me feel so small and s****y,” the star said. “I’m trying to share little jokes here and there about him because I like to keep that memory alive. My dad was a great dude, like, why is that a f****ing problem?</p><p>“I get defensive. It’s my family.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-long-list-of-high-profile-girlfriends>A long list of high-profile girlfriends</h2><p>From <a href=#>music</a> star Arian Grande to reality phenomenon Kim Kardashian, Pete has had quite some romances.</p><p>Pete dated Ariana, who <a href=#>recently divorced her ex-husband</a> Dalton Gomez, in 2018 and their relationship was a whirlwind – they were engaged after just four weeks of dating and were together for five months. She later broke things off, with fans speculating that it was due to the death of her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, who overdosed in September that year.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a>‘s time together was heavily publicized, with the pair sharing many photos and videos together online. Ariana even named a song after him on her 2018 album Sweetener, in which she sings “Universe must have my back / Fell from the sky into my lap / And I know you know that you’re my soulmate and all that.”</p><p>He then famously dated Kim, 43, last year. Again, the relationship was highly publicized and The Kardashians star was not shy when talking about their intimate life. Telling her grandma that they had sex by the fireplace in her honor (yeah, we had that reaction too). However, Kim later said that the nine-month-long fling was a “distraction.”</p><p>“It got my mind away from stuff and that’s not a way to run from things,” she told her sisters before advising them to “deal. Heal…Deal, heal, and then feel.”</p><p>Other women he has dated include Bridgerton actress Phoebe Dynevor and Kaia Gerber, who is the daughter of model Cindy Crawford.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Tom Holland and Zendaya’s adorable PDA restores our faith in romance</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2aDcLzErZxmnJGrtqW%2FzqeqZqyilrSqr4yloJ%2BdXajBsL7YZpmen5Gjeri0xKdkoZ1drK60ec6no7JlZ2LGpq3RrGSopJRk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./photographer-warns-beachgoers-not-squish-throw-jelly-like-sacs-wash-sand-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Photographer warns beachgoers not to squish or throw 'jelly-like sacs' that wash up on the sand">&larr;
