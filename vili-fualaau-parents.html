While <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vili Fualaau’s parents</a> testified that Mary Kay Letourneau ruined their son’s life, his mother Soona Vili had complicated thoughts about the woman who bore her two grandchildren.</p><p>Born Mary Katherine Schmitz on January 30, 1962, in Tustin, California, USA, she grew up in a middle-class family and had a relatively ordinary childhood. She attended Arizona State University and later became an elementary school teacher in the Seattle area. In 1984, she married Steve Letourneau, with whom she had four children. However, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>their marriage faced difficulties</a> and ultimately ended in divorce in 1999.</p><p>While teaching at Shorewood Elementary School in Burien, Washington, Letourneau developed a close relationship with one of her students. Vili Fualaau was only 12 years old when their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">relationship turned inappropriate</a>, and it became sexual when he was 13. In 1997, the illicit relationship was discovered, leading to Letourneau’s arrest. According to police reports, Mary Kay jumped from the backseat to the front once she realized officers were approaching the car while Vili pretended to be asleep in the back. They both provided false identification, including Vili claiming that he was 18 years old.</p><p>In November 1997, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Letourneau plead guilty</a> to two counts of second-degree child rape, and she was sentenced to six months in jail. As part of the plea deal, she agreed to undergo sex offender treatment and not have any contact with Fualaau. Despite this court order, Letourneau and Fualaau continued their relationship, and she was arrested again in 1998 for violating the terms of her plea agreement. This time, she received a seven-year prison sentence. During their testimony, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vili Fualaau’s parents</a> spoke of how they had no idea about their son’s relationship with his teacher.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=15.374533001245><h2>Vili Fualaau's parents</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-57241941.jpg><p>Not much is known about Vili Fualaau’s parents, Soona Vili and Luaiva Fualaau, but we do know that they were Samoan immigrants who welcomed their son Vili on June 26, 1983. Soona said she had no idea of the nature of her son’s relationship with his teacher.</p><p>In 2002, Vili and his mother sued the Highline, Wash., School District and the Des Moines, Washington, Police Department for $1 million, contending that officials should have noticed the warning signs around Letourneau. She was shocked because she had let her son stay over at Letourneau’s home and go on family trips with her. “How could you? <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>I trusted you</a>,” Soona confronted the sex offender during her testimony.</p><p>While incarcerated, Letourneau gave birth to two daughters fathered by Fualaau: Audrey Lokelani was born in 1997 and Georgia Alexis was born in 1998. While Soona told the court Letourneau ruined her son’s life, she harbored complicated thoughts towards the woman who bore her two grandchildren.</p><p>Soona told the court: “I can’t say I hate Mary. Just a couple of weeks ago my granddaughter turned around to me and asked, ‘Do you love my Mary mommy, Grandma?’ And I’m supposed to tell her ‘Yeah, I hate your mother?’ I can’t. I can’t. … And looking at my granddaughters, I can’t consciously say I hate this woman.” In the same testimony, she added that Letourneau was still abusing her son. She added, “I never condone[d] the relationship … what happened was morally wrong. She was married and this was a teenage boy, but I will do what I need to do to get through this.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.7551020408163><h2>Mary Kay Letourneau & Vili Fualaau's children</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-52774531.jpg><p>In 2018, Audrey and Georgia gave an interview with Australia’s Sunday Night talk show and reflected on their parent’s relationship. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">I think I understand about i</a>t, just like how it was surprising to people,” Audrey said. “It’s been feeling different because it’s not really been brought to our attention, just because we grew up with it, so we’ve adapted to it.”</p><p>As mentioned, Letourneau gave birth to both girls while she was in jail for sex offenses. Audrey was born while Letourneau waited for her initial sentence—six months with three months suspended, for second-degree rape of a child after engaging in a sexual relationship with Fualaau when she was 34 and he was 13 in 1996.</p><p>As part of a plea deal, the disgraced teacher was court-ordered to have no contact with Fualaau but violated the court order. Thus, she was arrested again in 1998 and this time, she received a seven-year prison sentence from 1998-2004. She gave birth to Georgia during that time.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.5><h2>What happened to Mary Kay Letourneau?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-57483843-1.jpg><p>Letourneau was released from prison in 2004. Following her release, she and Fualaau married in 2005. The marriage drew widespread media attention due to the controversial nature and origins of their relationship. Letourneau and Fualaau eventually separated in 2017 after 14 years of marriage. Fualaau filed for legal separation in 2019. Letourneau passed away on July 6, 2020, at the age of 58, due to complications from cancer.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
