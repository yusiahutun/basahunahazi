After founder Vicky Tsai visited Kyoto, Japan, she devoted her time to reading up on the Japanese ingredients and rituals that changed her skin during her stay. From there, she created Tatcha, which has grown into one of the most celeb-loved beauty brands on the market. It’s garnered attention from <a href=# rel=noopener>Selena Gomez</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Jennifer Aniston</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Meghan Markle</a> and so many more A-listers.

The range of elevated, multipurpose products are formulated in inclusive shades and undertones to suit every skin tone under the spectrum, and the nude theme extends from his color stories to the gorgeous packaging, too.</span></p><p><span>“I have always embraced my Asian heritage–it is something I’m incredibly proud of. To be able to launch a beauty collection that embraces diversity while celebrating individuality is really, really thrilling,” Wu says.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s1873405-main-zoom.jpg><h2>Ellis Brooklyn MYTH Eau de Parfum</h2><p><span>If you’re a fragrance aficionado, you need to know about the heavenly, multi-layered scents from <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Ellis Brooklyn</a>. Founder Bee Shapiro, a Williamsburg mom and former beauty columnist for </span><i><span>The New York Times</span></i><span>, made her mark with this incredibly chic line of clean and sophisticated fragrance options crafted with care in small batches.

Everything they launch is rigorously dermatologist and allergy-tested (formulas adhere strictly to the National Eczema Association’s ingredient guidelines)—plus, it’s all made in the USA.</span></p><p><span>As a second-generation Chinese American, founder Amy Liu is a mother of three and makes it a point to share her Chinese traditions with her little ones, and is active with the </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Asian American Girl Club</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/hero-cosmetics-superlight-sunscreen.png><h2>Hero Cosmetics Superlight Sunscreen SPF 30</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hero Cosmetics</a>, created by Ju Rhyu in 2017, makes formulas that work with rather than against your skin. Instead of harsh chemicals that can potentially irritate and damage your complexion, you get sensitive skin-friendly products that are actually effective. The brand gained traction with its cult-fave <a href=# rel=noopener>Mighty Patch</a>, a hydrocolloid pimple patch, but has since expanded its offerings to much, much more. If you have yet to find your go-to mineral sunscreen that is lightweight, doesn’t clog pores and doesn’t leave a white cast behind, it’s time to get behind Hero Cosmetics’ <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Superlight Sunscreen</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/U-beauty.jpg><h2>U Beauty Arm Compound</h2><p><span>Less is more when it comes to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">U Beauty</a>’s tech-driven, science-backed, high-performance skincare.

Check out the brand’s newly-launched gravity-defying <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Arm Compound</a>, which Craig deems “invisible shapewear for arms in a bottle.”</span></p><p><span>“I never felt represented in the beauty world, or anywhere culturally, for that matter. So I decided to represent myself. I’ve felt seen because I have </span><i><span>demanded</span></i><span> to be seen. I’ve simply never accepted anything less. Dismantling racist stereotypes and calling out injustices when I see them while honoring my culture is as vital to me as creating great skincare,” she says.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a-9Jd5tjL._SL1500_.jpg><h2>Velour Synthetic Lashes – Go Viral</h2><p><span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Founder Mabel Lee</a> recalls her small eyes being her biggest insecurity when she was younger, and loved the eye-opening effect false lashes had on her overall look.

The co-founders put their own modern twist on these traditional practices and ingredients. Take, for example, the brand’s award-winning <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Bian Stone Gua Sha</a>. Its unique shape can be used just about anywhere on your face and body to promote circulation, depuff, tone and ease tension.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Glametic-Lashes-amazon.jpg><h2>Glamnetic Magnetic Lashes – Venus</h2><p><span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Glamnetic</a> takes the guesswork out of applying magnetic lashes with their high-quality products and commitment to consumer connection. This LA-based brand exploded during the pandemic thanks to their loyal Gen Z audience and influencer network on social media, and they even opened up 70 additional jobs during a time when most companies were struggling just to merely stay afloat.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Growing up as an immigrant from Thailand, I often felt ostracized from my peers, but even on my worst days I found happiness and confidence through makeup.

Over a decade later, their line is still </span><span>synonymous with femininity, beauty and strength; and fuses statement prints and colors with luxurious fabrics and unique silhouettes to flatter the female form. “</span><span>We understand women’s bodies and were one of the first brands to sell bikinis as separates rather than sets,” explains Oleema.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Being Asian American means I have a rich background with a story of determination, passion, and faith in my lineage. I come from a line of strong-willed ancestors who I have learned are kind, graceful, and dedicated to their dreams, their love, and their will to succeed,” she says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$115 (was $234)</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Corvy.jpg><h2>COVRY Keid Rose Eyeglasses</h2><p><span>This inclusive unisex eyewear brand creates frames to flatter diverse face shapes, including low nose bridges, high cheekbones and more.
