And I'm sure that information was fed to Kass, and I can't imagine how damaging that was for him."</p><p>Marcil, meanwhile, has alleged that <a href=#><strong>she raised her son alone</strong></a>. In February, Green called out his ex's claim, prompting the actress to post a cryptic quote to her Instagram about "telling the truth."</p><p>Green maintains, however, that Marcil knew about his condition and how much he was struggling.</p><p>"To then find out after the fact that at the point when I started getting better, that she then was painting it that I had abandoned Kass during that time, when the reality was I was dealing with such brain fog in what I was going through," he added.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:59bd2d49-9488-49ef-9fb2-c09a2836627b data-container-ref=toofab:article:c350842a-ecc2-4bc1-8573-7829b405198a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/eb/5by4/2023/06/16/eb54bea34994457f9091900bb0c23f3a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Brian Austin Green Blasts 'Bad Father' Claims After Defending Megan Fox Over Sons' 'Girls Clothes'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Noting that he treated his recovery from vertigo much like a "stroke survivor would," Green shared that he had to relearn how to walk, talk and write.</p><p>What would have made their co-parenting relationship easier amid Green's health struggles, the actor said, is if Marcil had made more of an effort to ensure Kassius had time with his dad.</p><p>"It would've meant so much if Vanessa had decided 'Hey, Iâ€™m going to make sure while you're going through this that your son can still get to your house and see you,'" he said. "That would've just made an incredible difference in the situation. But that's not what went down, that's not how it happened."</p><p>Green, who was with Marcil for four years before calling it quits in 2003, would go on to tie the knot with <a href=#><strong>Megan Fox</strong></a> in 2010.
