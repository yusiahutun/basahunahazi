Now <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/feeling-good-the-future-of-the-1-5-trillion-wellness-market data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="worth 1.5 trillion dollars globally" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">worth 1.5 trillion dollars globally</a>, the wellness market has been accelerated by the pandemic and is growing by as much as 10 per cent a year. So, evidently, our desire for healthy habits looks set to stay.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unsurprisingly, given the scale of the industry, the core concepts of wellness can often get buried, instead viewed through the lens of trends. And herein lies in the subject’s pervasive problem: we often overlook the individual aspect of wellbeing, which is central to living a healthy lifestyle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The fact is, many wellness practises are intended to be followed on a bespoke basis, and while influencers and experts with platforms may be democratising the principles of wellness by sharing their takes on it, following what works for others can come with various negative consequences for the individual. Given that every body is unique, why don’t we treat it as such?</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Determining your diet and exercise</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When it comes to our nutritional health, following fads is never a good idea, whether for weight loss or nutrient gain. “It’s very important to take a personalised approach because biologically we are all unique,” explains <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://lindsoloves.wixsite.com/mysite data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lindsey Whistler" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Lindsey Whistler</a>, a registered nutritional therapist. She says that ultimately this is due to our unique gut microbiome. “Our microbes produce different responses to different foods, and as a population we only share about 30 per cent of microbes. If we were to recommend the same diet for everyone, it would work for some, but not for others, and for some people it may be extremely difficult.” Take the current trend of eating low-carb, high-fat: “Some may thrive on that, others may feel fatigued and find life very difficult”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Whistler says that health advice taken from the wrong sources is something she sees often. “There are a lot of people giving advice on social media who are not qualified, and blindly following what someone else is doing could be harmful. For example, I regularly hear recommended calorie counts of under 1200 kcals daily – that’s closer to a child's needs and could be damaging for a grown woman. The trend for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/fitness-wellbeing/a29571050/intermittent-fasting/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="intermittent fasting" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">intermittent fasting</a> is still going strong, but for some people fasting could really compromise their hormone health.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also observes how comparison culture intertwined with the wellness industry can impact people’s mental health. “Something else I see is frustration when what works for one person doesn’t work for another. Again, this is down to individual metabolism and needing a personalised approach from a health professional.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Haylene Ryan Causer, personal trainer, coach and founder of the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cafevolonte.co.uk data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Energy Studio at Café Volonte" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Energy Studio at Café Volonte</a>, echoes concerns around people’s feelings of inadequacy as a result of what’s trending on social media. When it comes to workouts posted on people’s feeds, she notes, “it is a highlight, a perfectly manicured moment, a posed workout – normally [it’s] just what would look good on camera as opposed to being actually beneficial to the user”. Consequentially Causer feels that the person seeing it “feels inadequate if they cannot achieve what is required, which can leave them with negative perceptions of health and fitness”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Naturally, when it comes to honing your diet and enhancing your fitness, it pays to get bespoke, expert advice – though of course this isn’t accessible for all.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Blindly following what someone else is doing could be harmful<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Whether you want to throw money at it or not, firstly, Whistler says, it’s important to use your common sense. “Make sure that you have got the basics right: sleep, vegetables, fibre, and water. Pay attention to your body – signs of irritation such as skin or gut issues are trying to tell you something.” And before experimenting with dietary supplements, she says that “if you are struggling with signs of a deficiency such as recurring colds or infections, brain fog, low mood, cold sores, low energy or feeling run down, go and see your GP who will arrange for blood tests”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That’s not to say she disapproves of the new cohort of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/mind-body/a26140056/best-beauty-supplements/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wellness supplements" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">wellness supplements</a> filling our shelves, be they protein powders, collagen drinks or sleep aids. “Some of these are nice to take in order to support your wellbeing, but mega-doses could be harmful at worst and ineffective and expensive at best,” Whistler warns. Plus, she cautions that “those taking prescriptions must speak with their doctor before taking any supplements as they may interfere with the medication, causing a change in efficacy and potentially harmful side effects”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A wellness movement she advocates for is <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/fitness-wellbeing/a25800386/intuitive-eating-tips/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="intuitive eating" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">intuitive eating</a> – when done properly – “because it goes completely against diet culture, which can be extremely damaging, not to mention exhausting.” Intuitive eating means tuning into your body’s needs rather than subscribing to the idea that you should be following any kind of diet plan, counting calories, or copying what someone else is doing. “It means paying respect to your body and the fact that you have individual needs. It’s also a weight-inclusive way of thinking that doesn’t assume that lower weights are associated with good health, and vice-versa.” Both experts feel that focusing on health rather than weight can be empowering, and help you develop a better relationship with your body and with eating and exercising.</p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="£25 at Waterstones for The Food Medic"

emevuu60">Personal trainers have long been banging the drum of a bespoke approach to fitness. It can mean setting realistic, achievable goals in line with unique measurements (your resting heart rate, blood pressure, body fat percentage etc), and considering your history – such as any injuries and potential weakness to be mindful of – to make measurable progress while avoiding plateaus. Doing so with an expert can mean motivation, accountability, and invaluable education, though naturally it comes with an exclusive cost.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Those looking for a more affordable alternative to this ideal might want to consider online personal training, a flexible alternative to a face-to-face PT. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ponzu.fit/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Ponzu class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ponzu</a>, for example, is a digital platform that connects people with professionals who provide personal guidance throughout tailored fitness and nutrition plans with live sessions. It was developed in response to uncovering that pre-recorded workout content leaves 53 per cent of people fearing they’re working out incorrectly, and 39 per cent losing motivation while taking part. The brand's ethos is formed on the simple concept that those who receive a tailored approach, combined with daily motivation of a trainer, achieve far better results.</p><img alt="skincare beauty regime combat stress" title="Skincare beauty regime - combat stress" width=745 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/skincare-beauty-stress-1597673364.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Richard Phibbs</span></p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Wellness therapies and practices</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Besides the obvious principles of food and movement, the cultural phenomenon of wellness is now embedded in all aspects of our daily routines. To everyone this means something different, but with any wellness practice it makes sense to take the perspective of one’s objectives. This means approaching relaxation and general self-care very differently to treating ill health.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“During the pandemic, many more trends and products for wellbeing emerged,” notes <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/renatanunestherapist/?hl=en-gb" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Renata Nunes" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Renata Nunes</a>, a qualified physiotherapist and acupuncturist. Though most are far from new, content producers and the media have recently put fresh perspectives on all sorts – from cold water immersion to smudging with palo santo and microdosing with psychedelics.

Likewise, there are also many therapies – such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a27304201/facial-acupuncture-cosmetic-benefits/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=acupuncture class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">acupuncture</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/spas-salons/news/g23327/best-massage-treatments/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=massage class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">massage</a>, or <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/fragrance/a23676400/essential-oil-diffusers/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=aromatherapy class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">aromatherapy</a> – that many of us utilise whether in turbulent times or not, which she feels can be beneficial – even without a bespoke approach. “Those that present a ready protocol, but with a unique purpose, can be beneficial when a patient has the objective of momentary relaxation, for example,” she says. In this case, simpler treatments can deliver “a momentary effect, in which the patient just needs to relieve emotional tension and relax”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's these short-lived effects of non-bespoke therapies that healer, spiritual life coach, aromatherapist and founder of Therapie, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://roquesoneil.com/pages/our-story data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Michelle Roques-O'Neil" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Michelle Roques-O'Neil</a>, too highlights as something to be aware of when buying into them. “They operate with a one-size-fits-all perspective; this may work only superficially, a temporary fix that offers some solace,” she explains. This is why, for example, when a patient visits a Chinese medicine practitioner that “evaluation and diagnosis must be done in detail to better understand and choose the correct treatment,” Nunes explains – be it acupuncture, moxibustion, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/a36381798/cupping-therapy/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=cupping class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">cupping</a>, massage, or herbal supplementation. She adds that “the human being is unique, and it is with this perspective that practitioners of Chinese medicine analyse each patient.” With this in mind, a person who is considered ‘in harmony’ “has no troubling symptoms and manifests mental, physical, and spiritual balance,” but when that person is sick, “the symptom is only a part of a complete body imbalance that can be seen in other aspects of his life and behaviour”. Therefore, a highly bespoke approach to treatment is considered imperative.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Naturally, hormones come into play, too. Nunes explains: “In the case of women, we are always careful to pay attention to variations during the cycle. This means that as much as treatment is individualised, one session can be different from the other, depending on the moment of the cycle in which it presents itself.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Roques-O'Neil says that pure aromatherapy, too, will always be part of a bespoke, targeted custom, combining “factors that are critical when dealing with more specific issues that people are struggling with”. While there are many high quality, pre-blended essential oils available for people to use at home, playing alchemist without sufficient knowledge and experience can be dangerous. “Aromatherapy is complex and nuanced, and very often, less is more,” she explains. “These oils are powerful volatile substances that need to be handled with know-how and respect. If you don't really understand the biochemistry and therapeutic application and work purely by aroma, you could easily blend oils that evoke an unexpected reaction.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As well as with essential oils, Roques-O'Neil has worked with crystals for over 20 years.

People are more knowledgeable about the energetics of their bodies, primarily through energetic traditions like acupuncture, Yoga and Ayurveda.” This, she notes, aligns with our collective thirst for natural and holistic solutions to support wellbeing on all levels. “Crystals are, after all, different combinations of minerals that help purify, balance, and realign by working with our bioenergetic systems.” Therefore, she feels that to offer significant benefits “as with aromatherapy, this practice requires skill and deeper understanding”.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Considering prevention and cure</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Identifying whether you are attempting to prevent, or cure, is also key to judging the importance of practising something in a highly individualised manner. As much as asking whether you’re presenting symptoms you are looking to manage (like brain fog), question the cause.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Hippocrates said it all six centuries ago,” Jenya Di Pierro, herbal medicine practitioner CEO and founder of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cloudtwelve.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cloud Twelve" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Cloud Twelve</a> wellness and lifestyle club says, quoting the ancient Greek physician, or ‘father of medicine’: “It is more important to know what sort of person has a disease than to know what sort of disease a person has.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For example, in naturopathy, “a headache can be a result of excess toxicity, stress, dehydration, poor circulation or muscular skeletal disorders,” Di Pierro notes. “So, in naturopathic medicine, five different people suffering from headaches may get five different remedies – that’s why it is so important to understand their individual characteristics and factors contributing to health”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Most of Di Pierro’s patients receive individualised remedies to address the underlying cause of their ailments, “while taking into account their digestive capacity, stress and toxicity levels”. For anyone experimenting with herbal medicine without professional guidance, she notes that “dosages, interactions, contraindications and red flags need to be taken into account when taking herbs for medicinal purposes”. For instance, “foraging of certain herbs can be unsafe if they are misidentified,” plus, she adds “there is a category of herbs called ‘schedule III’, that are medicinal in small dosages, but can be poisonous if recommended dosage is exceeded.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For those who want to safely boost their wellbeing using plants, without extra investment, Di Pierro says to start in the kitchen (think aromatic herbs for inhalation to clear congestion, and culinary spices to bolster gut immunity), though she has also created a range of herbal supplements for common complaints. One is a “destressing tincture” called Dreamer, “for people who are highly stressed, don’t sleep well, and need ‘crutches’ to help them through a stressful period of their life,” she explains. “It is always better to learn how to walk without ‘crutches’, but at the same time they can be lifesaving in the interim.”</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for How to get better sleep" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/f18aa71a-1e1e-4305-8d73-21c6b07a2a11/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1534174160_98765.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=37 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Being mindful in everything</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/mind-body/a32623799/difference-between-mindfulness-meditation/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Meditation class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Meditation</a> is considered by many as one of the main wellness tools at our disposal, and health’s third pillar alongside diet and fitness. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thegoodbody.com/meditation-statistics/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to statistics" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">According to statistics</a>, since 2012 the number of people practicing meditation has tripled, with between 200 and 500 million people meditating globally.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For better or worse, this is part and parcel of the commodification of wellness, with the value of the global meditation market expected to reach $9 billion by 2027.
