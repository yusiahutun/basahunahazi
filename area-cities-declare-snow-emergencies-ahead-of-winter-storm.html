We will need as much cooperation as possible from residents who park on the street to make this possible.”</p><p>The Push Back Policy provides snowplow crews the opportunity to push the snow back to the curb by instituting the alternate side parking plan.&nbsp;This means that cars should be parked on the even side of the street tomorrow (Wednesday), which will allow crews to push back to the curb on the odd side of the street.</p><p>On Thursday (an odd numbered day), cars should be parked on the odd side of the street so that crews can push back on the even side of the street.</p><p>“This should give us enough time to get everything pushed back before the next event on Friday and extreme low temperatures this weekend into next week,” Stineman said.</p><p>The company contracted for snow removal operations in Downtown Muscatine was clearing city parking lots Tuesday and will post the downtown area for no parking later today.

They will work as long as needed to move snow off the streets.”<br>He said that not all residential areas will receive a treatment with the brine mixture before the storm’s arrival, since only hills and known trouble areas usually receive the treatment. Public Works will run residential salt routes once the snow starts. Plowing in residential areas depends the amount of snow and the status of snow emergency routes.</p><p>The Musser Public Library in Muscatine will be closed on Tuesday.</p><p>The River Bend Food Bank Mobile Food Pantry in Muscatine will be closed on Tuesday.</p><p>The Transit Division (MuscaBus) will be switching to snow routes starting Tuesday.
