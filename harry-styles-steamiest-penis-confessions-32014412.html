Grinning for the camera with his hands under his chin, the singer showed off the sign that had been taped to the door of the cubicle.</p><p>It read: “Best schlong ever” - a dig at the One Direction hit track, Best Song Ever. It didn’t take long before his loyal legion of fans went wild immediately after he posted it.</p><p>One user giggled: “I feel like this joke had to start during One Direction” as another begged: “Prove it!” A third gushed: “He is so unhinged” as a fourth chuckled: “Please submit this for show and tell.”</p><h3>Leaked nudes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30428250.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_PAY-MAIN_Shocking-moment-Harry-Styles-winces-as-he-is-hit-in-the-face-with-a-flying-object-while-on-stage-in.jpg><p>It’s not just Harry who has supported this claim either, after his pal Ed Sheeran backed up the rumours of his rather large package in the past. In 2015, Ed was asked if he wrong the song Little Things for the boyband because of their literal ‘little things’.</p><p>But the singer songwriter was quick to shut that speculation down. He explained to New Zealand’s ZM Online: “Harry definitely hasn’t got a little thing, so no, I did not write ‘Little Things’ about little things.”</p><p>But the Lego House didn’t stop their with the eye-opening revelations, when he claimed that Harry accidentally leaked his own nudes online. He explained that Styles himself had been the leak of the personal image which was taken when he was 17.</p><p>He told the hosts: “Did you know Harry leaked that picture himself? He leaked his own picture! I think it’s amazing. He was just like, ‘Nobody knows’.”</p><h3>Strict film rules</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Since the embarrassing snap was leaked online, the hunk had avoided bearing his intimates to the general public any further. In his most recent film My Policeman, Harry insisted that there be a ‘No Penis’ clause written into his contract before he took on the role of Tom Burgess in the 2022 film.</p><p>During an interview on The Howard Stern Show, he recalled what it was like to act in the high-profile film. He told viewers: “It does feel vulnerable.</p><p>“I’d never kissed anyone on camera before and it felt like giving a part of myself away in some ways. I wasn’t naked in Don’t Worry Darling. I was naked in My Policeman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32014757.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Radio-1s-Big-Weekend-2022-Day-3jp.jpg><p>“There’s no peen in the final cut. There’s bum bum... I don’t think the peen was intended to be involved. The peen, it was pre-negotiated that that would remain my own.”</p><p>When discussing filming sex scenes on set, Harry confessed that the most important thing for him is “trust”. He added: “If you remember that the most important thing on the set is the two human beings doing it.</p><p>“If at any point either one of you is uncomfortable, I think having the conversation where it’s like, ‘It doesn’t matter if they’re getting great stuff, if you don’t feel good, you tell me and we’ll stop’.”</p><h3>Pulling 3-4 women in one night</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29515946.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_My-Policeman-Filmset.jpg><p>In 2013 when One Direction were at the peak of their fame, Harry apparently had a rather wild sex life. Nine years ago, it was reported that Niall had said: “Harry is just unbeatable. He never runs out of stamina!</p><p>“I’ve lost count of all the girls he’s pulled on this tour. He sleeps most of the day, then does the gig and stays up all night with pretty girls in his toom. He’s a total rock ‘n’ roller.”</p><p>Meanwhile, a source went on to say: “It’s incredible, he seems to have at least three or four girls in his room every night.”</p><h3>Soft spot for older women</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29515962.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Screen-Shot-2022-12-09-at-173814.jpg><p><b>Have you</b><b>joi</b><b>ned Thr</b><b>eads?

He previously confessed to getting into bed with one of his friend’s mum after a wild night out.</p><p>He admitted: “At my friend’s birthday party a few years ago, I got dared to go and get in bed with his mum. She was asleep and she woke up when I got in, so I just ran down the stairs.</p><p>“She had a robe on, but I don’t know if there wasn’t anything on underneath.” When he was 18 he said that he drew the line at any woman over the age of 44 which was his mum’s age at the time.</p><p><b>For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters</b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> <b><u>here</u></b></a><b>.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdlon5qqoq56tMDYpZysZaOpsqK5yJ6qrWWgmruqv4ycpqeelajAqrvNrGRsamBmgXV9kQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./witchers-diverse-cast-criticized-china.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Witchers diverse cast is criticized in China">&larr;
