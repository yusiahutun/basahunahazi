The pair had to face a bitter truth that the only child of their family was found dead with suspicious reasons. Although many people claimed that the sudden demise of their son was particularly because of the dismiss of his father's job following alleged sexual harassment&nbsp;case.</p><h3>Quick Information</h3><ul class=quickList><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong> <span>Jun 10, 1968</span></li><li><strong>Age</strong> <span>55 Years, 9 Months</span></li><li><strong>Nationality</strong> <span><a href=#>American</a></span></li><li><strong>Profession</strong> <span><a href=#>TV Personality</a></span></li><li><strong>Marital Status</strong> <span>Married</span></li><li><strong>Husband/Spouse</strong> <span>Eric Bolling (m.1997)</span></li><li><strong>Divorced</strong> <span>No</span></li><li><strong>Gay/Lesbian</strong> <span>No</span></li><li><strong>Ethnicity</strong> <span>White</span></li><li><strong>Children/Kids</strong> <span>Eric Chase Bolling (Died.Sept 2017)</span></li></ul><p style=text-align:justify>It is absolutely devastating&nbsp;for any parents to lose their child, so it is no surprise that Adrienne Bolling, the wife of renowned <a href=# rel=follow>American Journalist Eric Bolling</a>, had to go through an immense disruptive phase in her life. The pair had to face a bitter truth that the only child of their family was found dead with suspicious reasons. Today, let us help you to find out Adrienne's personal life and the reason behind her son's tragic death. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-172 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Adrienne Bolling's Married Life</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Adrienne&nbsp;and Eric got married in the year 1997, and they have&nbsp;been bound in a marital relationship for almost 21 years. Despite being married for such a long time,&nbsp;the duo has kept their marital life under the scanner with no details of the inside scoops.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In the year 1998, the pair was blessed with a son named, Eric Chase Bolling, who is no more with his parents. As per wiki, the body of their only child, Eric, was found dead lying on his bed&nbsp;on September 8, 2017.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Adrienne&nbsp;Bolling's beloved son, Eric Chase Bolling&nbsp;with his father, Eric Bollin, photographed back in November 2017 (Photo:&nbsp;dailymail.co.uk)</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Reason Behind Eric's Death</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Many people had said that the young lad attempted&nbsp;suicide because of the emotional torture that he had to go through. At the time of the death,&nbsp;the family had remained skeptical in sharing the proper details, Ericâ€™s dead body was found at the time when his father got fired from the Fox News.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Also View:</strong><a href=# rel=follow>&nbsp;Brian Kilmeade Career: Salary and Net Worth Of Fox News Reporter</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Adrienne and her husband were on their way back from their date when they got the most devastating call no parents ever want to receive. They were informed that their beloved 19-year-old son Eric Chase Bolling had died. Eric had been found dead the very next day that his father was fired from Fox News after an investigation revealed he had sent explicit photos of his genitals to female colleagues at the network. Due to the timing of the death, there was speculation that the teen might have committed suicide because he was devastated by his father being fired.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>You Might Want To See:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Trace Gallagher Married, Wife, Salary, Net Worth and Fox News</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Reports had said that Eric was filled with extreme emotions when the leading news broadcasting channel showed the exit door to his father. Fox news did not spare&nbsp;the reporter as he was job free before the final proceeding of the investigation. With the successful soaring height in the career of journalism, the alleged mark in the professional career of his father could have led Eric to lose control over life.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Although Eric Bolling had tweeted the grief and tragic moment of their only child in the family, he also urged people not to exaggerate anything till the proper investigation is carried out. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187></span><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify>Twitter post of Eric Boiling clearing the allegation about the suicide of Eric Chase (Photo: Eric Bolling's Twitter) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>But the speculation was put to rest when it was later revealed in the autopsy that the cause of death of the teen was&nbsp;from an accidental drug overdose. It was revealed it the autopsy that&nbsp;Eric Chase had taken a mixture of cocaine, marijuana, Xanax, and two opioids -&nbsp;fentanyl and cyclopropyl fentanyl which led to the death of the teen.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Fentanyl&nbsp;is the&nbsp;same drug that also killed music icon Prince. It is classified as a Schedule II drug by the federal government it is 50 times stronger than heroin, up to 100 times stronger than morphine. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Don't Miss:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Adam Pally Wiki, Married, Wife, Gay, Family, Drugs, Arrested, Net Worth</a></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Career And Net Worth</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Till date, Adrienne has been very private in sharing the information that is related to her professional career. With her quiet nature in revealing any details of her profession despite being the wife of the famous conservative political commentator, it seems that she is possibly a complete housewife without any job titles.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-710 data-method=ai-placeholders class=ezoic-autoinsert-ad></span><p style=text-align:justify>So, without any sufficient facts on her possible job, it becomes even more challenging to find the actual source of her earnings. Besides her income, her husband's net worth is estimated to be around $25 Million.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-native_bottom"></span><h2 style=text-align:justify>Short Bio</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Adrienneâ€™s actual age is still a mysterious piece of information to the readers as there are no sufficient facts of her birth details or birthday. She holds an American nationality and belongs to white ethnicity. She stands a decent height with appropriate body weight measurement.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2r7HTsKarrJhjsLC5jpycpZ2Sp7a1tcSsZpqcop6yr7rEZpmopJyeu6h51qKiomWRnLJussCmoKWxXZ%2B8o3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5wKWjZpmSpMK1ecSroJxlkqS5rbXNoGSsZaees6Z6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brian-mulroney-former-canadian-prime-minister-dead-84.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brian Mulroney, former Canadian Prime Minister dead at 84">&larr;
