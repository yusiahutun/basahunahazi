He is the only son of Tracy Marrow, popularly known as Ice-T, the talented American rapper, and his former partner of 17 years, Darlene Ortiz.</p><p>He has aged like fine wine and now sports his dad’s good looks. But that’s not all Tracy inherited from the iconic rapper. Indeed, Tracy Marrow Jr also seems to have gotten his dad’s rap genes and is now in the process of becoming a top star like him.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep reading to learn more about Tracy and his life as the son of a star and an upcoming rapper.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/trac-708x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tracy_Marrow_Jr_Biography></span>Tracy Marrow Jr Biography<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He is the only son of famous American rapper and actor Ice T. He was born on November 23, 1991, in Los Angeles, California, United States, which makes him American by birth and a Sagittarius as far as star signs are concerned.</p><p>Ice-T welcomed him while he was with Darlene Ortiz, his then-longtime partner. The pair reportedly met while he was a budding rapper on the film “Breakin'” set in 1984. Their relationship lasted for 17 years before they decided to call it quits in 2000.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Tracy_Marrow_Jr_Do_for_a_Living></span>What Does Tracy Marrow Jr Do for a Living?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tracy Marrow Jr., also known as “Lil’ Ice,” was born with talented genes that have prompted him to follow in his dad’s footsteps by pursuing a career in the music industry.&nbsp;Having shown off his skills, he has become a member of Ice-T’s heavy metal band Body Count and has joined his father on stage to perform on various occasions.</p><p>In 2015, Tracy’s mom, Darlene Ortiz, pointed out some similarities between her son and his father. She <a href=#>said</a>:&nbsp;</p><p>“I couldn’t even think of anybody that can top his dad, but he is so much more than his dad. Ice would take up anything and master it. But this one? His little seed, this kid. It’s been so entertaining. He does everything: flies planes, plays poker, golf, already got a hole-in-one — who does that even in their life?”</p>Darlene Ortiz.<p>Aside from his work in the music industry, Tracy Jr. is also an ambassador for Raising Cane’s, an American fast-food chain, alongside his father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ice.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tracy_Marrow_Jr_Siblings></span>Tracy Marrow Jr. Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The young upcoming rapper has two half-sisters. LeTesha Marrow is regarded as the oldest daughter of Ice-T, a product of his relationship with his high school girlfriend, Adrienne.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike Tracy, LeTesha did not enjoy a lot of Ice-T’s presence and love in her life. This is because he was still very young when he had her and focused on his career and survival.&nbsp;</p><p>He <a href=#>told</a> People in 2016: “When I had my first kid, I was in the middle of the wildness of becoming Ice-T, all the people that were after me, and I had my head down. I wasn’t concentrating on them. I was concentrating on survival.”</p><p>LeTesha became a parent too in 1995 after she welcomed her son, Elyjah Marrow, making Ice-T a first-time grandfather. She mostly flies under the radar. However, she has appeared on some episodes of her Ice-T’s reality show “Ice Loves Coco” with her son in tow.</p><p>Tracy’s second sibling is his younger half-sister Chanel Nicole Marrow, the product of his father’s marriage to Coco Austin. They welcomed Chanel after about 14 years of marriage. Ice T wanted Coco to be truly ready to become a mom.&nbsp;</p><p>He said: “Just because I was finished with the clubbing and the partying doesn’t mean she was. It’s like Disneyland. I can’t say, ‘You don’t want to go, all the rides suck.’ You gotta go for the rides.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tracy.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tracy_Marrow_Jr_Relationship></span>Tracy Marrow Jr. Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Already in his 30s, many expect Tracy Marrow Jr. to have dated women, but if he has, he keeps their traces from the spotlight. At this time, it is unknown if he is in any form of relationship.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tracy_Marrow_Jr_Net_Worth></span>Tracy Marrow Jr. Net Worth&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thanks to his successful career in the music industry, Tracy Marrow Jr. receives income as a musician, and at the time of this writing, his net worth is believed to hover in the $2 million range.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, his father, Ice-T, has a whopping net worth of about $65 million, most of which is proceeds from his music career. He has released tracks with greats in the music business, including Ice Cube, Kool Keith, 2Pac, Biggie Smalls, and <a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwbOtwrJkppmip7y4ecmrZKadlal6qq%2FEZqusZZykvKyty6KinmWjpLtw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./never-share-wifi-password.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why You Should Never Share Your Wi-Fi Password">&larr;
