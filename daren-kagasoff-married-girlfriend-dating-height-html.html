The journey involves going out on dates, rejecting and facing rejections; so to make the matter more relaxed, people usually enlist the characters they want in an ideal partner.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Actor&nbsp;Daren Kagasoff, famous for his role as Ricky in the ABC series Secret Life of American Teenagers, is often seen having multiple flings in the series. But he is a different man in real life. He believes in relationships and has even disclosed the qualities he wants in his ideal girl.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>But has he found his perfect girl or is he still on the hunt? Keep reading to find that out! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>High-School Girlfriend To Actress Girlfriend; Quality Of Ideal Girlfriend</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>The award-winning actor Daren Kagasoff often indulged with girls on screen, but in real life, he prefers maintaining a low profile. So the real love life of the Secret Life of American Teenagers star remains a concern for his followers.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Moving down the memory lane, Daren marked the beginning of his love life in high school which lasted two years. That longevity, however, did not lead them to married life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>See Also:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>ABC's Lara Spencer Got a Divorce With Her Husband Ended 15 Years of Their Married Life: What About Children?</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>While recalling the experience, he accounted being so smitten by the relationship that his focus on everything else, including his school work, seemed to wear off. He even admitted to learning a lesson.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>&nbsp;"I definitely learned never to fall in love in high school because it just takes over your brain. We were so psychotic for each other that I didn't care about anything else. It was too much. Relationships are important but stay focused on all the things that are important. Figure out what you want."</p><p style=text-align:justify>Back in 2008, Daren&nbsp;got his big break with the role of Ricky Underwood&nbsp;starring&nbsp;opposite the Golden Globe-nominated actress Shailene Woodley as Amy. As he entered the world of glamour, he was no longer a commoner and was, therefore, followed and searched by many.</p><p style=text-align:justify>With 229k followers on Instagram, he sure has become a celebrity. But, did he find someone on his journey after a wrenched heartbreak with his high school girlfriend? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Although he remains single as of now, previously, he was linked with his<a href=# rel=follow> co-actress Shailene&nbsp;Woodley</a>, and he could often be observed flaunting the romantic relationship.&nbsp;The series wholly centralized&nbsp;on the love-life of the character Ricky and Amy, and&nbsp;it definitely ended on a happy note.</p><p style=text-align:justify><img alt height=800 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/celebrity/daren%20kagasoff%20shailene%20woodley%20love%20costar.jpg width=600 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Daren Kagaoff with his Secret Life Of An American Teenager co-star Shailene Woodley</strong>&nbsp;(Photo: clevver.com)</p><p style=text-align:justify>Well, Daren and Shailene's five years long hot chemistry on-screen undoubtedly gave the audience a chill.&nbsp;As a result, their fans couldn't help but surmise that they were an item, for it seemed their emotions had spilled over off-screen.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Read Also:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Divorce with Married Husband of 25 Years in 2008, Carol Kirkwood Finally Finds Her Mr. Right. Boyfriend?</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>But, aside from the rumors, there are no reliable sources to establish their liaison as a fact, though Daren did admit to having a crush on Shailene and claimed that she is girlfriend material. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Moreover, it looked as if Shailene reciprocated with Daren's&nbsp;feelings&nbsp;as well. As per Shailene,</p><p style=text-align:justify>"Daren is a really awesome guy, and anyone would be dead lucky to be with him. I am dead lucky. See if you can figure it out.”&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>When we put the pieces together, the only conclusion we seem to form is that they dated. But the rumors had it that their relationship was too hard to sustain, with busy schedules on both ends. Perhaps their real love life did not end as scripted&nbsp;in the series!</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Read Also:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Calum Hood Totally Open To Dating!

On the one hand, it seemed that he was linked to his co-actress, while on the other,&nbsp;we could not ignore the steamy pictures&nbsp;of Daren walking arm in arm with the actress Jacqueline Wood.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Well, he has been dating Jacqueline for quite a long time: the news of their affair dates back to 2009. Their love life spilled out in public when they were captured locking their lips by paparazzi.</p><p style=text-align:justify><img alt height=860 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/celebrity/daren%20kagasoff%20jacqueline%20wood%20kissing.jpg width=600 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Daren kissing his then-girlfriend, Jacqueline Wood</strong> (Photo: JustJaredJr.com)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Don't Miss:-</strong><a href=# rel=follow>&nbsp;Michael Rainey Jr. Wiki: Details On Family And Net Worth!</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>But he remains interested in being in a relationship, as he has disclosed the qualities he seeks in his ideal girlfriend. As per Daren, the duo was often&nbsp;spotted shopping, clubbing, and casually strolling together. But, they slowly alleviated their presence from the media and ended their relationship with a silent departure.</p><p style=text-align:justify>&nbsp;"I want a girl who lets me do my own thing, but who is going to be by my side the whole time, because I know I'd be supportive of her."</p><p style=text-align:justify>Daren, who had his&nbsp;first smooch when he was just thirteen, further admits that the lady should be a&nbsp;good kisser. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-636 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>&nbsp;And kissing is a big thing for me! You have to be a good kisser."</p><p style=text-align:justify>Instead of sharing the social media screen with the beautiful ladies, in 2018, he seems to content into his family life with parents. On 14 May 2018, he shared the picture of himself with his mother on Instagram referring to her as 'gun gun,'&nbsp; and wished her "Happy Mother's day."</p><p style=text-align:justify><img alt height=845 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/celebrity/Daren-Kagasoff-mother.JPG width=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><strong>Daren Kagasoff wishes mother on Mother's Day</strong> (Photo: Daren Kagasoff's Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Similarly, on the father's day, he shared the picture with his dashing father on Instagram on 18 June 2018 wishing him, "Happy Father's Day."
