However, due to a sweet moment, he shared with his wife, her name became Blue Ivy.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-911539130-1024x836.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jay-z-tells-of-the-meaning-behind-blue-ivy-s-name>Jay-Z tells of the meaning behind Blue Ivy’s name</h2><p>Talking to <a href=#>TV</a> host Gayle King, Jay, whose birth name is Sean Carter, explained that they planned for their first daughter’s name to be Brooklyn as not only did the couple have a deep connection to the borough of New York City, he also grew up there.</p><p>He said, however, that this changed when the pair started going to see their growing bundle of joy at pregnancy scans. The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> began to call her Blueberry because of her small size.</p><p>“We was calling her Blueberry. Like, ‘Look at the little blueberry.’ You know, it was like a nickname. It just was natural,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained</a>.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Selena Gomez celebrates Taylor Swift’s birthday for ‘damage control’, say fans</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-beyonce-gave-fans-another-meaning-for-her-daughter-s-name>Beyoncé gave fans another meaning for her daughter’s name</h2><p>Before Jay-Z spoke about Blue Ivy’s name last month, Beyoncé had already discussed their daughter’s unique name. Soon after Blue’s birth in 2012, the <a href=#>music</a> star took to Tumblr to post an extract from a poem in a book called Field Guide to Getting Lost by Rebecca Solnit.</p><p>The paragraph deals with the color blue and how the “purer” water is “the deeper the blue.”</p><p>“The world is blue at its edges and in its depths. This blue is the light that got lost. Light at the blue end of the spectrum does not travel that whole distance from the sun to us,” it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reads</a>. “It disperses among the molecules of air, it scatters in the water. Water is colorless, shallow water appears to be the color of whatever lies underneath it, but deep water is full of this scattered light, the purer the water the deeper the blue.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dinner-with-jay-z-or-500k>Dinner with Jay-Z or $500k?</h2><p>After years of a rife social media debate on whether fans would have dinner with Jay or take the cash lump sum of $500, the man himself has had his say on the matter …</p><p>Surprisingly, he told King during the same chat that, actually, <a href=#>people should take the money</a>.</p><p>“You gotta take the money. What I’mma say?” he said.</p><p>After the host explained that users on X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>) believed that the “wisdom they would gain would be so beneficial,” the rapper insisted that they should take the money and said that it was a “bad deal.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t tell you to cut a bad deal,” he explained, before giving himself a cheeky plug and telling fans that they should use the hypothetical money to buy his albums. He said that he couldn’t tell a fan anything that he hadn’t already through his music.</p><p>“If you piece it together and really listen to the music for the words, for what it is, it’s all there,” he said, “Everything that I said was going to happen, happened. Everything that I said I wanted to do, I’ve done, and there’s the blueprint.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Matt Damon kept Winona Ryder romance off the radar and now doesn’t date ‘celebrities’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aAcLbAsmSzZaKaw6aty6xkraCVYsC4scStZKadkaO2r7OMm5yhoZ6ZeqO41J5koq6pqHqvrcyeZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brief-history-of-seinfelds-girlfriends-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Brief History of Seinfelds Girlfriends, Told by the Women Themselves">&larr;
