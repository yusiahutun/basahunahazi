One surefire way to make your products actually work for you? Adding a facial steamer to your skincare routine. These skin-tech devices are part-humidifier, part-spa treatment, and 100 percent worth the counter space (in fact, most face steamers are super portable and ideal for small areas).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Facial steamers are all over the place in price (we’re talking anywhere from $7 to over $200)—so how do you know which face steamer actually does its hydrating duty? We tested 14 of the best face steamers to gauge which options were easiest to use and most effective. After our extensive lab tests, these are the best facial steamers for dewy, supple skin.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-plum-beauty-spa-facial-steamer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Value</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Plum Beauty Spa Facial Steamer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1125 data-sizes=750px alt="Plum Beauty Spa Facial Steamer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bAMuZovIkdzClJioSPfwjjfOuwQ=/fit-in/1500x1125/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/051022-plum-spa-facial-steamer-listicle-embed-2571f8f36682453d9fcb65fa95dc1e2d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Look and Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>It may leak water.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our top five picks for the best facial steamers span a variety of price points. That said, when it comes to value, you can't beat the Plum Beauty Spa Facial Steamer. Logistically speaking, the steamer is one of the smaller devices on our list, yet it works particularly well at targeting every area of the face — something not every device can do — so you don't have to move it (or your face) around to get full-faced results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond its applaudable coverage, this facial steamer touts a quick set-up, equally-as-rapid mist, and a convenient auto-shutoff mechanism that turns the machine off after the 6-minute steam cycle. Another convenient element? It's compact and comes with a handle, so it's easy to move from room to room or even to bring on vacation. (And since it's designed to be plugged in, you won't have to worry about bringing extra batteries — though, a converter may be necessary.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our testers found it to be a great value for the quality (and steady stream) of steam it put off. Surprisingly, they found that it doesn't even require much water to work, and it's easy to empty in residual water after use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for the results it delivers, our testers were pleased with how it transformed their skin in such a short amount of time. "My skin feels very soft," one tester marveled post-use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Number of Settings:</strong> 1 | <strong>Steam Cycle: </strong>6 minutes | <strong>Steam Type: </strong>Fine | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>5.8 x 5.1 x 10.1 inches | <strong>Auto Shut-Off: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-conair-true-glow-moisturizing-mist-facial-sauna-system></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Conair Facial Sauna System</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1125 data-sizes=750px alt="Conair True Glow Moisturizing Mist Facial Sauna System" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KqSLRfzws2CpGbl1gCnNoP7Z6Jw=/fit-in/1500x1125/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/051022-conair-true-glow-facial-sauna-system-listicle-embed-8c5ffb1218fa485db626a0c157f10f03.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta Beauty</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Look and Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This pink and white facial steamer might look a bit dated but our testers found it to work extremely well — especially given the price point. In addition to delivering fine, steady mist, this facial steamer touts a whopping seven settings — ranging from three to 15 minutes — allowing users to tailor the duration of treatment based on their skincare goals and the time they have to devote to the process. Additionally, while the machine can easily be flipped on or off, it is also designed to automatically shut off when the timer pings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another well-liked feature of this steamer is the size of the facial cone. "I sealed my face in the cradle of the steamer and received good results," one of our testers says. "My skin was evenly covered. I love this product."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this facial steamer has a variety of great design features, one of our testers did point out that it requires a bit more patience to use, as it takes longer to heat up. Still, users can expect to refreshingly steam their face within four minutes of activating the device, so it's not like you'll have to hang around waiting forever.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, something that makes up for the slow heat-up time is the fact that this facial steamer comes with a battery-operated facial brush to further tend to the user's skin. The facial brush comes with two different attachments to gently cleanse and exfoliate the skin, which is recommended prior to steaming.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Number of Settings:</strong> 7 | <strong>Steam Cycle: </strong>3-15 minutes | <strong>Steam Type: </strong>Fine | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>7.38 x 7.75 x 9.25 inches | <strong>Auto Shut-Off: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-multipurpose-pure-daily-care-nanosteamer-3-in-1-nano-ionic-facial-steamer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Multipurpose</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pure Daily Care NanoSteamer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pure Daily Care NanoSteamer 3-in-1 Nano Ionic Facial Steamer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6Afifhux2x_9QP9jy3FDTTO7pW8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nanosteamer-f9c62caf8c0b4550ab9a34cab4b0d721.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As one of Amazon's top-selling facial steamers, our testers were excited to see how the Pure Daily Care NanoSteamer held up to its accolades and claims. Sure enough, it touts a design worthy of the stellar reviews it's received.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Part of what makes this facial steamer so beloved is its multipurpose nature. Instead of solely being a facial steamer, it's designed to be used as a humidifier and towel warmer, as well. As such, rather than emitting between three and 15 minutes worth of steam, this sleek facial steamer pumps out up to 30 minutes of fine, steady mist. And, once it's finished misting, it conveniently shuts off, so the user doesn't have to worry about doubling back home to check if everything is unplugged.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing to note, however, is that like the Conair facial steamer, the Pure Daily Care NanoSteamer takes a touch longer to heat up, again falling around the 4-minute mark. That said, once it's steaming, it's steady and warm, and works well to open pores and soften skin. But, as one of our testers points out, thanks to the slightly smaller cone, it doesn't fully envelop the face in mist. "The mist reached my forehead and cheeks but not my chin area," they say. So, if you opt for this device, just know that you might have to move your face around a bit to achieve full results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">(Psst: This device also comes with five extraction tools for even more spa-like effects. That said, make sure they're sterile and you know how and when to use them before applying pressure and putting them to work on your face.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Number of Settings:</strong> 4 | <strong>Steam Cycle: </strong>Up to 30 minutes | <strong>Steam Type: </strong>Nano | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>9.84 x 5.91 x 1.97 inches | <strong>Auto Shut-Off: </strong>Yes</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="Person Using Pure Daily Care Steamer 3-in-1 Nano Ionic Facial Steamer" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/CLobyHAnk3SaQdJKMlWaZFKDO9o=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/byd-pure-daily-care-nanosteamer-tamara-staples-01-ccc5124937aa4944bc1344e3f5063f9a.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / tamara staples</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="Person Using Pure Daily Care NanoSteamer 3-in-1 Nano Ionic Facial Steamer" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/F26-9ZymnwEKZNSuBSdDsO7fGBM=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/byd-pure-daily-care-nanosteamer-tamara-staples-03-270b6d48632d4759b192799d6a64be05.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / tamara staples</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-dr-dennis-gross-skincare-pro-facial-steamer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Pro Facial Steamer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1125 data-sizes=750px alt="Dr. Dennis Gross Pro Facial Steamer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xvzO_wdiA7DSWFrlHZ-EmZOYxr4=/fit-in/1500x1125/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/051022-dr-dennis-gross-facial-steamer-listicle-embed-34ba67d3c22243e5b36928eb5c33264a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Look and Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>Undeniably, it's pricey.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While splurge beauty products aren't always worth the hype, the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Pro Facial Steamer deserves every bit of praise it's received. It was a no-brainer for our initial list of products to test — and once we put it to work, our testers quickly unveiled just how luxurious it really is.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although it only comes with a single setting, the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Pro Facial Steamer pumps out a cloud of ultra-fine mist for a steady nine minutes which makes it well worth the splurge. "This was incredibly easy to use," one of our testers says. "The tiny water tank was easy to fill up and it was steaming in a solid stream of mist within 30 seconds."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Solid as the mist was, our reviews say that it's gentle as can be. "My skin isn't irritated — it was a strong, consistent mist without coming on too strong," they say.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the set time sequence is nine minutes, you can shut off the device whenever you please. When one of our testers did so in half the time, she still found the results to be remarkable. "My skin definitely feels softer," she reveals. "I only used it for four minutes and I'm confident that with more steam, my skin would look even better. This is a popular facial steamer for a reason. I could sit in front of this thing for a while — it was very relaxing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Number of Settings:</strong> 1 | <strong>Steam Cycle: </strong>Up to 9 minutes | <strong>Steam Type: </strong>Micro | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>10.3 x 7.7 x 5.6 inches | <strong>Auto Shut-Off: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-a-spa-like-experience-vanity-planet-aira-ionic-facial-steamer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for a Spa-Like Experience</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vanity Planet Aira Ionic Facial Steamer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vanity Planet Aira Ionic Facial Steamer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dnTEifWRm5bUe9UbT8QyrsVIAsE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vanity-planet-aira-ionic-facial-steamer-16a41f91b784462ebfdcf930cccc95e9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Look and Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Take your at-home spa day to the next level with this Vanity Planet face steamer. While we appreciated the ionic tech that allows for a deep, penetrating clean of your pores, this device stood out because of its essential oil compatibility. Soak the diffuser pads in your favorite essential oil, then place the pads in the basket and attach to the nozzle for a truly relaxing ritual.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Vanity Planet face steamer is also a small, manageable size that makes it ideal for anyone who doesn’t have yards of bathroom counter space to store various gadgets and products. The water basket is seamlessly hidden within the steamer, which took us a few minutes to figure out—but once we did, we were thrilled with the results of our DIY facial. Our biggest confusion was around the instructions to only use distilled water to prevent limescale buildup. One editor (who has owned the device for over three years) admitted to only using tap water and not noticing any damage to the steamer as a result.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Number of Settings:</strong> 1 | <strong>Steam Cycle: </strong>Up to<strong> </strong>15 minutes | <strong>Steam Type: </strong>Ionic | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>‎5.2 x 4.7 x 8 inches | <strong>Auto Shut-Off: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-a-deep-clean-sarah-chapman-skinesis-pro-hydro-mist-steamer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for a Deep Clean</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sarah Chapman Skinesis Pro Hydro-Mist Steamer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dermstore Sarah Chapman Skinesis Pro Hydro-Mist Steamer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DQgfo4Kxt9YrSnfe5qM2Db3h2w4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sarah-Chapman-Skinesis-Pro-Hydro-Mist-Steamer-cae426a6ae8a4bc2ba40e111fb887204.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To really flush out your pores and make your face feel squeaky clean, we’d recommend this face steamer from famed aesthetician Sarah Chapman. Like the Vanity Planet facial steamer, this product relies on an ion generator to produce steam particles packed with negative ions—all the better for penetrating the skin, warming the pores, and cleansing your skin from makeup, dirt particles, and more. We also love the convenient carrying handle for transporting the facial steamer from your sink to your home spa area.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The water tank clearly marks how much to fill the chamber for a 5 or 10-minute treatment, but the steam cycle only runs for five minutes at a time. After that, if you want the extra five-minute boost, you have to press the power button again, which took us out of our relaxation mode a bit. Note that the manufacturers recommend using filtered or distilled water only. This device is meant to be used on a flat surface only, and we’d recommend sticking to that rule—we noticed the water tank leaked a bit if it wasn’t on a totally even surface.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Number of Settings:</strong> 1 | <strong>Steam Cycle: </strong>Up to<strong> </strong>55 minutes | <strong>Steam Type: </strong>Ionic | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>‎10.2 x 8.3 x 5.5 inches | <strong>Auto Shut-Off: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In an effort to make spa-like results achievable at home in your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>comfy bathrobe</a>, many, many manufacturers have launched their version of a facial steamer. As such, we did our due diligence — by talking with dermatologists and aestheticians, as well as researching products on our own — to hand-select the 14 most compelling facial steamers on the market.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Considering the main purpose of a facial steamer is to address dryness and leave skin looking dewy and hydrated, we curated a group of testers with skin concerns that fit the bill. Once assigned, they got to work to weed through the 14 initial picks in an effort to narrow it down to the top facial steamers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To do so, our testers rated each steamer on a scale of 1 through 5 in three key categories: ease of use, skin look and feel, and mist quality. After all, while steam is undoubtedly the most important factor of a facial steamer, the results it delivers and the way the machine itself operates play a pivotal role in the overall satisfaction of the device.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once all the reviews were in, we determined the categories for the top facial steamers.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ease of Use</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At-home facial steamers are popular beauty buys because they make otherwise luxurious spa treatments more accessible. However, like all <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>facial tools</a> and beauty products, if they're not easy to use, the results may feel null and void. With that in mind, we tested each of the 14 facial steamers for ease of use. In doing so, we took set-up, straightforward settings, and auto-shut-off buttons into consideration. Out of all of our winners, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Plum Beauty Spa Facial Steamer</a> had the most convenient features, especially for beginners.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Skin Look and Feel</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Facial steamers are designed to deliver spa-like facial results in the comfort of your own home. Of course, they have to work steadily (and all-encompassingly) in order to deliver said results. With that in mind, our testers paid close attention to how each of the facial steamers made their skin look and feel after use, with a goal of smoother, softer, glowing, more supple skin post-use (our tester's skin felt the most supple after use with our Best Overall pick, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Panasonic Nano Iconic Facial Steamer</a>).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Mist Quality</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Considering the mist is the whole point of a facial steamer — particularly what makes a device effective and convenient or not — we paid close attention to the type of mist that each machine produced. Generally speaking, the smaller the mist, the better able it is to penetrate the skin and deliver deep hydration, and the less likely it is to make a mess. As such, our top picks all feature fine (or micro or nano) mist, as it delivers the best complexion results without splattering the surrounding area.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are the benefits of using a facial steamer?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to NYC-based board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Dr. Michele Green</a>, facial steaming helps to clear your pores for a deeper cleanse. "The main benefit is that the steam softens your skin which makes it easier to remove dirt, sebum, and blackheads," she says, noting why steam is a popular component of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">facials</a>. Remember: pores don't open or close—they aren't a muscle—but rather stretch when they are clogged.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to promoting a deep clean, Dr. Green says that steam helps promote circulation and keep skin hydrated. "The steam will cause your blood vessels to dilate and allow for more blood and oxygen to reach your skin," she explains. "This will also help promote collagen and elastin production which will keep your skin looking soft and youthful.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lastly, Dr. Green points out that by declogging pores and adding hydration, steams helps skin better absorb skincare products. "When your pores are clear, your skin is more permeable and can more effectively absorb the active ingredients you use on your face," she explains.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How often should you use a facial steamer?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As soothing as facial steaming can feel, like any skincare product or treatment, you don't want to overdo it. "A facial steamer should be used once or twice a week for ten minutes," Dr. Green says. "This will ensure your skin is not irritated and that you reap maximum benefits. That said, if while adhering to those guidelines you notice your skin is feeling hot or irritated, Dr. Green says that you should reduce your steaming time to find what works best for you. "It is essential that the steam is a safe distance from your face, usually six to ten inches away," she adds, noting that proper placement of your facial steamer will help reduce the risk of irritation.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are facial steamers beneficial for all skin types?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Green, no. "Facial steaming is not recommended if you have sensitive skin, eczema, psoriasis, or rosacea," she warns. "If you have any concerns about facial steaming or the best skincare practices, you can always consult a board-certified dermatologist."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While facial steaming can help rehydrate skin, making it great for folks with dry complexions, Dr. Green says that those with acne-prone skin are the best candidates for facial steaming. "The steaming will help stretch your pores, which will make it easier to extract sebum, dirt, whiteheads, blackheads, and other debris," she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-instyle-picks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is InStyle Picks?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Did you notice the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>InStyle Picks seal of approval</a> at the top of this story?
