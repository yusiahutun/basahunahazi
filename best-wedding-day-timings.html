But <strong>have you started thinking about what the best time to get married is? </strong>As the world's most indecisive person who finds herself paralysed over major decisions at the best of times, organising&nbsp;something as seemingly innocuous as the timings for my wedding day has turned me into a frenzied ball of anxiety.</p><p id=eMi_XMYjLWsC data-wc=1><strong>DISCOVER: <a class=hm-link href=#>How to save £1k on your wedding dress by going second hand</a></strong></p><p id=elkaDmsm5gWs data-wc=75>The most popular time to get married is 1pm or 2pm, but with 350,000 weddings set to take place in 2022 according to statistics from the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>UK Weddings Task Force</a>, you might not have been able to secure the perfect&nbsp;slot. So how do you make your day flow if you're stuck with a 4pm registrar booking, or you've got a 12pm ceremony and are plagued with visions of the day dragging on and guests twiddling their thumbs?</p><p id=eHlWhxwxMxAF data-wc=9><strong>WATCH: 9 most stunning celebrity weddings to inspire you</strong></p><p id=eWJiz3GRiowo data-wc=29><strong>We asked Sophie Rymer, Operations Manager at Grade I listed and&nbsp;medieval moated venue <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Birtsmorton Court</a> near Malvern, Worcestershire, for her expert advice about getting your wedding day timings just right.</strong></p><p id=eFUKYRGAhjPE data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Should I hire a wedding planner?

It depends on how you want your big day to play out.</p><p id=esp9QOtYbpLI data-wc=50>Sophie advises <strong>thinking about whether you want evening guests first and foremost</strong>. "If there are a lot of extra people bringing new energy to the party for the evening, go a little earlier, if there isn't you can pretty much get married at whatever time you'd like to," she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0328b6f96711-birtsmorton-court-view-jarek-lepak-z.jpg><p id=eKZplivnRYxJ data-wc=15><strong>Sophie Rymer from Birtsmorton Court talks us through the ideal wedding timings. Photo: ©Jarek Lepak</strong></p><p id=ebTUWN0sRw-6 data-wc=34>If you're planning on having friends or colleagues arrive after the wedding breakfast or think evening food is a must, go for the earlier booking. If not, later in the day might work best.</p><h3><strong>What are the biggest timing mistakes to avoid?</strong></h3><p id=ePbA2Yh_urHT data-wc=55>It's not about the time per say, but more about how you choose to fill the hours. Sophie explains: "For me, the biggest mistake made with timings is having a chunk of time during the day or evening celebrations when nothing is really happening. <strong>Guests' energy quickly drops when there's nothing for them to do.</strong>"</p><p id=eLu1lBzMUqPf data-wc=44>Consider booking a band to liven things up after the sit-down meal. This gives people something to focus on before the dancefloor gets going and creates a talking point among your guests.<strong> A cheaper option might be hiring a photobooth or providing garden games.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3bca6a27a728-birtsmorton-court-garden-z.jpg><p id=ebW3wMkeUQXC data-wc=9><strong>Think carefully about the timings of your wedding day</strong></p><p id=e37hdpS3YNH9 data-wc=32>On the flip side, if you've booked a later ceremony time, be very strict with your timings and ask your master of ceremonies to keep things snappy and flowing throughout the day.</p><h3><strong>What are the best timings for your wedding reception?</strong></h3><p id=eYywltvO3eFi data-wc=69>Sophie says it's imperative to kick things off in a timely manner straight after the ceremony, and to ensure it takes up just the right amount of time – not too long and not too short! Two hours is ideal; enough time to get around and chat to everyone, take photos and enjoy canapés, but not so long that guests start to get itchy feet and impatient for dinner.</p><p id=eyfwdyrALiz1 data-wc=1><strong>DETAILS: <a class=hm-link href=#>5 biggest trends for couples planning a second wedding in 2022</a></strong></p><p id=eOl78PVexF-V data-wc=30>A key piece of advice?<strong> "Background music is a must. It helps add to the atmosphere and allows for guests to settle into the day from the off," </strong>Sophie reveals.</p><h3><strong>What are the best timings for your wedding breakfast?</strong></h3><p id=eAwrUicfzvTI data-wc=51>The wedding breakfast typically works well mid to late afternoon, leading into the early evening. Couples often feel anxious that guests won't get lunch, meaning it's a very long wait for a meal, so make sure you include the meal time on the invite, giving guests the opportunity to plan ahead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/940dcbd4680f-birtsmorton-court-oobaloos-photography-z.jpg><p id=eJsLIhRT2eSh data-wc=15><strong>Warn your guests about what time they'll be sitting down to eat. Photo: ©Oobaloos Photography</strong></p><p id=eiWQ6Dt0jRMT data-wc=21>Serving canapés is a good way to create a talking point amongst your guests and will make the afternoon pass quicker.</p><h3><strong>What are the best timings for your speeches?</strong></h3><p id=eh8sNxy_qyM- data-wc=45><strong>Speeches can be a huge time waster – or time spinner if you need to kill some time! </strong>We've all been at a wedding where the father of the bride rambles on for hours, however, so make sure to give speech-makers a strict time limit.<strong></strong></p><p id=eA-sSA6dvzTi data-wc=81>"I'm a big fan of keeping all three speeches together, it doesn't matter hugely if this is before the starters or after the meal has finished," Sophie says. "If the groom is going to be nervous or knows his best man is going to be, do them before the wedding breakfast, if not, save them for after and let guests have something to eat first. It's also nice to consider doing them between the main course and dessert, that works well.</p><p id=eVi3QHUNd8Uh data-wc=50>"I always advise couples to <strong>avoid having the speeches between the starter and main course.</strong> It's really problematic for caterers as they don't know how long speeches will last and cooking perfectly for 100 guests with no exact idea of timings can cause a real headache and risk overdone meat."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/802251420258-birtsmorton-court-katie-hamilton-photography-z.jpg><p id=eOwRMzOgDlORP data-wc=9><strong>Schedule your evening guests' arrival meticulously</strong><strong>. Photo: ©Katie Hamilton</strong></p><p id=ebLkVR8jFHxVJ data-wc=42>She continues: "It's become quite popular to split the speeches between each course. If this is the plan, allow a little extra time for this part of the day as getting toast drinks poured, speeches started and guests seated&nbsp;does take time."</p><p id=eYC9VeQy3lTdB data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>10 most expensive places to attend a UK wedding – and how much you need to save</a></strong></p><h3><strong>What are the best timings for your evening guests to arrive?</strong></h3><p id=eJiL-WuuJNC4u data-wc=60>Ideally, tell evening guests to arrive half an hour after the meal has finished. There's nothing worse for evening guests than arriving midway through the speeches, causing embarrassment for all parties. Allowing a little time after the day's celebrations have ended means that if things have run behind schedule, there's the opportunity to catch up before the other guests arrive.</p><p id=eZmWZvPlbCZzA data-wc=30>Also, remember that if you're getting married on a weekday, your guests are likely to be coming straight after work, so there's no point asking them to arrive at 5pm.</p><p id=eNJ_ZUyVhjO2U data-wc=30>Evening guests may travel for the party, however, so<strong> try to avoid inviting them to arrive any later than 8pm</strong>, unless you plan to keep going until the early hours!</p><p id=e0_x0PVL3058e data-wc=25><strong>Planning your wedding?
