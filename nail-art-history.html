So I went into my wallet, took money out, cut it up, and did a French manicure.” The result, now known as money nails, became a defining moment in the history of hip-hop and beauty. The look went viral before the internet did, garnering the attention of the Treasury, which reminded Thompson that defacing dollar bills was illegal. “Fast-forward nearly 20 years and I get a call from MoMA,” she says. “Never in my wildest dreams did I think anything I did would be in a museum with Picasso and Basquiat.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the decades since, scandalous, glamorous, and even more over-the-top manicures have taken on a life of their own. You’ve probably seen takes on crystal “extendo” nails, epitomized by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/nailson7th/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jenny Bui’s work with her longtime client Cardi B" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Jenny Bui’s work with her longtime client Cardi B</a>, at your local grocery store.

It wasn’t always like this.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nail art has been around since ancient Egypt, when members of the upper class dyed their nails with henna. During the Tang dynasty in China, imperial concubines had their own exclusive process based on crushing flowers for the required pigments. Polished nails set you apart from the masses. An elaborate set means at least that much today, as a professional manicure can take several hours and cost a pretty penny.</p><img alt="florence griffith joyner’s nails at the 1988 summer olympic games in seoul" title="florence griffith joyner’s nails at the 1988 summer olympic games in seoul" width=1600 height=1067 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz080123btynails-017-preview-64c931f9e3069.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Florence Griffith Joyner’s nails at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What’s always been true is that our nails are a vehicle to express who we are or who we want to be. The 1950s saw the invention of the first acrylic sets. Two decades later, bold nails became a beloved form of cultural expression in Black and brown communities, long before they were ever spotted on a runway. It wasn’t long before extravagant nails were deemed distracting and unprofessional—a racist dog whistle. In 1988, the Chicago Tribune called Olympic medalist Florence Griffith Joyner’s famous manicures “dragon-lady fingernails” that looked “both dangerous and incapacitating”; she didn’t keep her nails short and neutral, making her a deviant compared with her white competitors. Now, an elaborate manicure is often a good-luck charm for Olympic athletes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The “dragon-lady fingernails” moment was also a pointed insult stemming from Asian stereotypes: Both Black and Asian cultures have been the leaders of nail art around the world, with Japan and South Korea pioneering innovative nail technology and launching top artists for decades. Artists like Park Eunkyung, who goes by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/nail_unistella/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@nail_unistella class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@nail_unistella</a> on Instagram, have popularized more trends than I can count.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The work of Thompson, Bui, Park, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/ginaedwards_/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gina Edwards" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Gina Edwards</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/misspopnails/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Miss Pop" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Miss Pop</a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/nailsbymei/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mei Kawajiri" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Mei Kawajiri</a>, among so many others, has helped usher in a new golden age of nail art—one in which the unique perspectives of artists from a range of backgrounds and experiences that cut across class, race, and gender are celebrated.</p><img alt="nail art 2023 ideas and inspiration runways" title="nail art 2023 ideas and inspiration runways" width=1460 height=724 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2023-08-01-at-12-56-22-pm-64c93942d5875.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FROM LEFT: DIANE BONDAREFF, LAUNCHMETRICS/SPOTLIGHT (2)</span><p>An edgier take on the classic French manicure by Gina Edwards at Prabal Gurung’s Fall 2023 show; money nails seen at Fe Noel’s Spring 2023 show; the anything-goes manicure at the Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood Spring 2023 show</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This collective love for nail art has resulted in an explosion of global talent. Rita de Alencar Pinto, the founder of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/vanityprojects/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Projects," class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Vanity Projects,</a> a salon with locations in New York and Miami, hosts nail artists in residence from around the world because she treats them as artists first. “I was able to reach out to top artists through Tumblr and offer them job opportunities and a residency program,” she says. “We started with pop-ups during Art Basel Miami Beach in 2012 and moved on to museums—and now the artists in my salons are the best of the best.”</p><img alt="history of nail art, nails by mei kawajiri" title="Welcome to the Golden Age of Nail Art" width=1260 height=1600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz080123btynails-012-preview-64c81a8bb8c9d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">RICHARD MAJCHRZAK/STUDIO D</span><p>The nails pictured here were designed by artist Mei Kawajiri, who goes by @nailsbymei on Instagram, and pulled from her archive of famous looks. As one of today’s most influential artists, Kawajiri joins a growing list of international talent whose unique styles are ushering in a new era of nail mania.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Still, nail artists have had to advocate for their work to be considered part of a runway look. “In the ’90s, nail brands weren’t a factor backstage at all,” says Edwards, who recently created four designs for Prabal Gurung’s Fall 2023 show. “People would say nails weren’t that important. It made you feel so inadequate! But more designers appreciate us now because they realize it’s part of the look.” She remembers going from her work being dismissed in those early years to spending hours per manicure making 3-D acrylic butterflies for the Alice + Olivia Fall 2019 show. “The wings were made separately from the body. It looked like it was lifting off the nail,” she says. Nail art is sometimes so essential to a runway moment that designers hand off fabrics and trims from the collection to the nail artists to incorporate into the manicures, like when Edwards added the chandelier crystals from Pyer Moss’s 2021 couture show to the nails. Now a staple at fashion weeks, nail art in all forms has infiltrated high fashion, red carpets, and, undoubtedly, your TikTok algorithm.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pandemic’s DIY boom pushed our hunger for tutorials and nail content even further. “People doing their own nails is definitely a trend,” says Kawajiri. Born in Japan but now based in New York, she specializes in maximalist nails, works with clients like Dua Lipa, and is considered one of the most influential manicure tastemakers of our current era. Kawajiri credits social media for today’s anything-goes manicures. “Nail trends are always changing because of TikTok. Lengths and shapes are all different, and it’s more genderless; everyone can have art, extensions, and you can even have different lengths on the same hand,” she says. “You can play with confidence and without fear of judgment. Nail culture has more freedom now!”</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>New polishes to inspire your next salon visit<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqeZmaHAcK2TbWpxaGZsfXC6wKKjZpmiqXqptdKtpquxXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jason-aldean-atlanta-braves-day-jobs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jason Aldean Swaps Cowboy Hat for Baseball Cap to Play With the Atlanta Braves">&larr;
