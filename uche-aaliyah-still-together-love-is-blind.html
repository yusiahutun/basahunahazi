The answer is no. Uche Okoroha and Aaliyah met in The Pods on Love Is Blind Season 5.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Uche and Aaliyah did not get married, according to public records from the Harris County Clerk’s Office in Texas, where Houston is located and Love Is Blind Season 5 was filmed. There is no record of Uche and Aaliyah receiving their marriage license, which means they were likely not one of the couples that got engaged in the Love Is Blind Season 5 finale. At the time of Love Is Blind Season 5’s premiere, Uche and Aaliyah were not following each other on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>Uche and Aaliyah seemed to break up in Episode 4 of Love Is Blind Season 5 when a producer told Uche that Aaliyah chose to leave the show after he revealed that he and Lydia, another contestant and Aaliyah’s best friend in The Pods, dated before filming started. They officially broke up in Episode 7 when they met up for the first time after The Pods and Uche told Aaliyah that he was ending their relationship for good because of the way she reacted to his past with Lydia. At the time Love Is Blind Season 5 premiered, Uche and Lydia were not following each other on Instagram.&nbsp;Aaliyah confirmed she and Uche were not back together in the Love Is Blind Season 5 reunion.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>E! News</a> in September 2023, Aaliyah confirmed that she and Uche were not still together after Love Is Blind Season 5. “Making the decision to leave, I felt like it was the best thing for me. It was really hard because I had a lot of love for him,” she said. “At the moment, I was like, ‘Man, I just don’t feel like this is the type of situation that I would want going into an engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>Lydia told E! News that she was “shocked” when she learned that Uche and Lydia dated before Love Is Blind Season 5. “I was very shocked. I just felt it was super hard for me to process everything. I had fallen in love so fast. I was all in, and there’s a lot of room to be like, ‘Man, I don’t know about this.’ But it wasn’t just the reveal of their past, it was conversations that I had had with Uche,” she said. “Like any other dating situation, you learn things about them and people put their best feet forward in the beginning, and then the flaws start to come to the surface on both sides, and you’re like, ‘I don’t know about this.’ So that’s where I was, even before the reveal of knowing they had a past.”&nbsp;</p><p>Despite everything, Aaliyah told E! News that she didn’t regret her time on Love Is Blind Season 5. “I was super nervous at first, and as I got more used to being in the setting, it was really exhilarating and refreshing to be in there, seeking out love and trying to find a partner in that way was so cool. It’s just different. It’s unique,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Uche is a 34-year-old lawyer and entrepreneur from the Houston, Texas, area. His Instagram handle is @<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">imabovethelaw</a>. “Nearly 2 years ago I was asked to be on Netflix’s “reality TV” show @loveisblindnetflix – It definitely wasn’t what I was expecting, but I’m glad I’ll be able to share the story soon! If you want to follow along, it premieres September 22,” he captioned an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> post in September 2023 announcing he was on Love Is Blind Season 5.&nbsp;</p><p>Read Uche’s official Love Is Blind Season 5 biography from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Netflix</a>’s website ahead: “As a lawyer, Uche is used to letting his analytical mindset take over, but in the pods he knows that he’ll have to lead with his heart. After being single for two years, he’s ready to switch up his dating habits, especially when it comes to putting an emphasis on physical appearance. Instead, Uche is looking to connect with an ambitious woman with a good sense of humor who’ll join him to create an ‘us against the world’ way of life.”</p><p>Aaliyah is a 29-year-old ICU travel nurse from the Houston, Texas, area. “I’m happy to finally be able to share @loveisblindnetflix opened the pods up to ya girl! Follow my journey on Season 5 of Love Is Blind only on Netflix 🤎 First episodes air Friday, September 22 🥰 Enjoyyyyyyyyy! ✨ #loveisblindnetflix #loveisblindseason5,” she captioned an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> post in September 2023 announcing she was on Love Is Blind Season 5.&nbsp;</p><p>Read Aaliyah’s official Love Is Blind Season 5 biography from <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Netflix</a>’s website ahead: “Aaliyah flies all around the country for work, but when it comes to love, she’s always missing her connection. She’s been living the single life for more than a year and keeps meeting men who ‘aren’t truly ready to commit’ or lack ‘honesty, loyalty, and consistency.’ Aaliyah’s dream guy is an intellectual foodie who can feed her stomach and her mind. If she can stop overthinking, the ‘pure and gentle’ relationship she’s seeking could be right around the corner — or through a glowing blue wall.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfqrCpsYyamKWhqZa1br%2FToqOlZaSktKbAx56pZqSfq7JutdJmmaWhnpl8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./emily-paris-star-lucas-bravo-goes-shirtless-new-smouldering-wonderland-magazine-photoshoot-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emily In Paris star Lucas Bravo goes shirtless in new smouldering Wonderland magazine photoshoot">&larr;
