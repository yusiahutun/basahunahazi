For those who are unfamiliar with that name, Blevins is a social media personality. To be exact, he is a social media personality who is best-known because of his Twitch streaming, which has enabled him to build a sizable subscriber base because of Fortnite. Currently it has been estimated that Blevins has a net worth of around $6 million. However, it is important to note that there is further evidence suggesting that his net worth is changing on a regular basis, so much so that interested individuals shouldn't expect the estimate to remain true for too long.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":" table id="tablepress-47" class="tablepress tablepress-id-47" thead tr class="row-1 odd" th class="column-1"Net Worth/thth class="column-2"$6 Million/th /tr /thead tbody class="row-hover" tr class="row-2 even" td class="column-1"Name/tdtd class="column-2"Richard Tyler Blevins/td /tr tr class="row-3 odd" td class="column-1"Age/tdtd class="column-2"28/td /tr tr class="row-4 even" td class="column-1"Born/tdtd class="column-2"Detroit, Michigan/td /tr tr class="row-5 odd" td class="column-1"Birth Date/tdtd class="column-2"June 5, 1991/td /tr tr class="row-6 even" td class="column-1"Source of Wealth/tdtd class="column-2"YouTube Personality, Gamer/td /tr tr class="row-7 odd" td class="column-1"Country/tdtd class="column-2"United States/td /tr /tbody /table "}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4737,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"12":0,"15":"Arial"}'><table id=tablepress-47-no-2 class="tablepress tablepress-id-47"><tr class="row-1 odd"><th class=column-1>Net Worth</th><th class=column-2>$6 Million</th></tr><tbody class=row-hover readability=1.5><tr class="row-2 even"><td class=column-1>Name</td><td class=column-2>Richard Tyler Blevins</td></tr><tr class="row-3 odd"><td class=column-1>Age</td><td class=column-2>28</td></tr><tr class="row-4 even"><td class=column-1>Born</td><td class=column-2>Detroit, Michigan</td></tr><tr class="row-5 odd"><td class=column-1>Birth Date</td><td class=column-2>June 5, 1991</td></tr><tr class="row-6 even" readability=3><td class=column-1>Source of Wealth</td><td class=column-2>YouTube Personality, Gamer</td></tr><tr class="row-7 odd"><td class=column-1>Country</td><td class=column-2>United States</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2>How Did Ninja Reach His Current Net Worth?</h2><p>Blevins's rise has been meteoric. For starters, he has been involved in gaming for some time, as shown by the fact that he has played Halo on a professional level. This is a significant achievement for a gamer, but up until very recently, Blevins wasn't particularly high-profile by the standards of social media personalities. For reference, he is believed to have had around 28,000 subscribers on social media sites in March of 2017, which is a considerable number but far from being enough to enable him to stand out from numerous other gamers out there.</p><p>However, things started changing when Fortnite came out. For those who are unfamiliar with that name, Fortnite started out when the people at Epic Games came up with the idea of combining a shooter with a construction game, thus leading to the development of Fortnite: Save the World. Said game was supposed to be focused on survival-shooter scenarios in which the players would have to team up to fend off monsters with buildable fortifications. However, it wasn't until the people at Epic Games noticed the huge success of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds that they realized that they could make a battle royale game as well by using the same assets from Fortnite: Save the World, thus resulting in Fortnite Battle Royale. Initially, Fortnite Battle Royale was supposed to be secondary to its predecessor, but soon enough, its popularity outstripped it, as shown by the fact that it has been released on everything from PC, macOS, iOS, Android, PS4, Xbox One, and the Nintendo Switch whereas its predecessor is limited to PC, macOS, PS4, and Xbox One.</p><p>Regardless, Fortnite turned out to be a huge success, so much so that it has broken into the mainstream. Naturally, Fortnite streamers have become popular as well, which is important because it turned out that Blevins was very, very good at the game. In fact, Blevins is so good at the game that he was invited to play the game with Drake and other celebrities in March of 2018, which actually winded up breaking viewership records on Twitch.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, a higher profile means more followers, which in turn, means more subscribers. Each Twitch subscription costs $5 a month, with the result that $3.50 goes to the streamer, who would be Blevins in this case. As a result, when the number of Blevins's followers shot up into the millions and millions, his subscribers shot up into the hundreds of thousands. By the earlier half of 2018, Blevins was confirmed for making more than $500,000 on a monthly basis because of his Twitch subscribers, which is not counting his YouTube revenue stream as well as any sponsorships that he might be able to land.</p><h2>Further Considerations</h2><p>Due to this, it seems safe to say that Blevins's current net worth is higher than $6 million. However, the most interesting part is how high it will rise in the long run. Currently, Fortnite is a true cultural phenomenon, but it remains to be seen how long that state of things can last. Generally speaking, most games have a limited period of time during which they are popular before they start to fade out. However, there are some games with so much momentum that they can be played by a huge number of people for year after year, particularly if they continue to receive support from the developer. For proof, look no further than the fact that there are still people playing World of Warcraft even though the base game came out way back in 2004. As a result, it seems probable that Blevins can remain successful for some time on nothing but Fortnite, which is not even including his earnings potential from his streaming of other games.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6OyurXNnGWcp51ku6q6yZpkp52kYsSwvtOhZmVkXGF5bXg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nipsy-hussle-killed-in-shooting-outside-his-la-store.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nipsey Hussle Killed In Shooting Outside His LA Store">&larr;
