No, literally burning. With fire.</p><p>Nike revealed the new faces of their 30th anniversary ad campaign for the "Just Do It" slogan, and one of them was former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Across a black-and-white image of his face are the words, ""Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ecd153f7-e095-5014-ac62-289f2ec7e73e data-container-ref=toofab:article:02e69920-f86f-5daa-abe0-c33ddeb7e32b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/65/5by4/2018/09/04/65071771b5f45b6385eb607f23b5cbc4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Hollywood and Beyond Troll MAGA Fans for Burning Nike Gear After Colin Kaepernick Becomes Face of Campaign</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>And so conservatives decided that they believe so strongly against this ad that they are willing to sacrifice their own Nike apparel, burning their shoes and cutting the Nike swoosh off of everything from t-shirts to socks. Trevor Noah, Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers couldn't help but laugh at them protesting the company by destroying merchandise they'd already paid for.</p><p>On top of that, their issue is with Kaepernick, who they hate because he was protesting police violence against black people. So a protest</p><h2 class=h2>The Daily Show with Trevor Noah</h2><p>Trevor Noah marveled at the boycott fever that seems to be sweeping the nation. From conservatives wanting to boycott "First Man" because it doesn't show Neil Armstrong planting the American flag on the moon to liberal stars and staffers boycotting a New Yorker event because Steve Bannon was going to be there, it all culminated in the biggest and wildest boycott yet.</p><p>Nike announced Colin Kaepernick as part of their latest "Just Do It" campaign, and conservatives lost their minds. The campaign's slogan ("Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.") has been mocked by conservatives as well, but even Noah had to get in on that; it's just too easy.</p><p>"It seems really uplifting with Kaepernick's photo," he said of the slogan. But it's also the motto of many gambling addicts."</p><p>"People are so angry they're burning their own shoes," Noah marveled. "You realize Nike already has your money, right? They've already got your money. You're only hurting yourself. I would love to see how they'd protest Home Depot. 'All the walls in my house must go!'"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b661a53a-3e15-582d-a130-e764d5cc06b1 data-container-ref=toofab:article:02e69920-f86f-5daa-abe0-c33ddeb7e32b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d6/5by4/2018/09/04/d64b3d57b85a539bab6a17c7a35b73dc_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Abby Huntsman Squares Off Against Co-hosts Over Colin Kaepernick In 'The View' Debut</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>Jimmy Kimmel Live</h2><p>"People were so upset they started cutting the swoosh out of their socks," Kimmel said, showing one of the viral protest images. "Finally something dumber than eating Tide pods."</p><p>He also marveled at the fact that they were protesting Nike by destroying clothing they'd already purchased, meaning there was no impact on Nike at all. Granted, most of them have also said they'll never buy from Nike again, so the long-term fallout might have more of a notable impact on the company should enough people follow suit.</p><p>Kimmel couldn't help but laugh at what this latest development means for conservatives. "They can't watch the NFL, they can't ride Harleys, they have to burn their Nikes, they can't go to Starbucks or watch Netflix and they have to love Vladimir Putin and hate the FBI," he listed. "If this was a practical joke, it would be one of the greatest practical jokes of all time."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f8ac9798-3eb1-5f1f-af71-01176694778b data-container-ref=toofab:article:02e69920-f86f-5daa-abe0-c33ddeb7e32b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/53/5by4/2018/08/13/53d0fda543a957e1adec60418b38aa3a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Sacha Baron Cohen Convinces Gun Rights Activist to Put Bite Down on Dildo to Fight Terrorism</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>Late Night with Seth Meyers</h2><p>"After Nike announced that former NFL quarterback and activist Colin Kaepernick would be the face of its new ad campaign, angry consumers began posting photos of themselves burning their Nike shoes," Seth Meyers said. "Unfortunately, he's also been named the face of Yankee Candle and now they don't know what to do."</p><p>It's a thinker.</p><p>Later in the show, Meyers admitted that as a white male he didn't feel completely comfortable commenting on this racially-tinged issue. But no worries, because Amber Ruffin was more than ready to chime in, and she did so by echoing the complaints Kaepernick and other kneeling NFL players heard for their protests..</p><p>"Protest is a right guaranteed under the Constitution but there is a time and place for that, and the Internet is neither the time nor the place," she said. "I'm tired of you people politicizing shoes!"</p><p>Check out her full rant in the video below.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
