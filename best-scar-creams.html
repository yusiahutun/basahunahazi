Some of us wear them proudly as a sign of strength,&nbsp; but if you don’t want yours to be front and center on your skin, it’s equally brave to choose to move on from them. And for that random gash you got from running into a tree branch as a kid, we’d bet you’re probably less passionate about keeping that forever reminder of your clumsiness (no judgment — we have them, too).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whatever your reason, we’re here to help. Minimizing a scar is not as straightforward as getting rid of a small pimple or evening out a rough complexion, so we decided to test more than 30 of the most popular over-the-counter scar creams available on our own scars for three months to see if our markings became lighter or fainter.&nbsp; We found that some scar creams were better at healing recent markings, while others took on the tough challenge of making old scars disappear. We took loads of photos from the very first day to the very last day of the three month test to track our progress and accurately observe how our scars progressed each week. We also made sure to note if the application triggered any uncomfortable or tingly sensation, or required far too many applications a day. Once we collected the data and tallied the scores, we curated this list of the very best scar creams out there so you can make your own ancient history (if that’s what you want to do).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-biodermis-epi-derm-c-strip-silicone-scar-sheets></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Biodermis Epi-Derm C-Strip Silicone Scar Sheets</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Biodermis Epi-Derm C-Strip Package" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Xpl9xV5RppJ_LlIjweqUheTOHj4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/epiderm-895b57ef49ab4a9db816e7d9216fdec2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Scent</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Our stubborn scar dramatically reduced in size and color — and we had tried plenty of options over the years that were ineffective.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There’s only one strip in the package that lasts about two weeks, give or take.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Knowing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>how to fade a stubborn scar</a> is tricky. Fast, effective, and pain-free, this Biodermis Epi-Derm strip treated a three-year-old C-section scar previously left unchanged by other creams. And by treat, we don’t necessarily mean completely erase, but dramatically lighten and shrink. The package comes with a singular strip that we had to apply to the scar and leave on 24-7 except when bathing or swimming, until the strip loses its adhesive power—which for us happened at the two-week mark. At first, the idea of keeping a strip constantly on sounded strange, but it ended up feeling completely invisible, even hydrating, making the whole experience quite comfortable. It never stung or tickled, nor did it have any scent, allowing us to commit to our treatment fully. The clear strip fit over our scar perfectly, looking and feeling invisible while on. After one week, we were already able to see some serious changes in the thick C-section scar we had been prepared to live with for the rest of our lives.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What we didn’t love was that there was only one strip included, which lasted us about two weeks before getting too dirty to keep using. While we washed it every day, it was not enough to make it go beyond half a month. This treatment is an investment in time, and sure money, since you need to buy a new strip every two weeks, and it’s one of the pricier options. However, we saw such an impressive outcome that we feel the results justify the cost.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.4 inch x 6 inch<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Silicone<strong> | Scented: </strong>No <strong>| Time to Results: </strong>1 week</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-scaraway-silicone-scar-gel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ScarAway Silicone Scar Gel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ScarAway Silicone Scar Gel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YcHuBR-yCtPSFD8D2Dc7WAoU6W8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/scargel-80713fd32f204fafbcda338d5899849e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ScarAway</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Scent</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This scar cream creates a hydrating and soothing effect.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish the results were a little more noticeable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the impressive results scar creams can provide, they don’t have to come with an equally substantial price tag, like this gel from Scaraway. We tested this scar gel on a mark that was left behind from a melanoma removal, which settled into bright shades of purple, pink, and white.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At first, we loved how easy it was to apply the roll-on stick to the affected area on the chest, releasing just the right amount of product without wasting any. The gel dried down quickly, leaving a very hydrating and cooling sensation on our skin. We equate the texture to the consistency of an aloe vera gel, delivering equally soothing effects that didn’t transfer onto our clothes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After two weeks of daily morning and night application, we noticed the first signs of improvement on our scar. The raised part of the scar became less bumpy and the coloration looked less angry, blending into the natural color of our skin more. At the end of testing,&nbsp; it didn’t completely remove the scar itself, but it felt like a huge relief to see some changes already appear in such a short time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.35 oz <strong>| Key Ingredients:</strong> Polysiloxanes, silicon dioxide<strong> | Scented: </strong>No<strong> | Time to Results: </strong>2 weeks</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="A person shows a scar on their chest" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xm9ccWDvcog6VEk5L5AfHp9MziA=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-scar-creams-test-scaraway-silicone-gel-anna-popp-02-724482e9499840ad827cafb860cc12c0.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Anna Popp</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2538 data-sizes=750px alt="A tube of Scaraway Silicone Scar Gel is held in the air" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bY73lZWNyiukb94Wf-fBdziFpUQ=/fit-in/1500x2538/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-scar-creams-test-scaraway-silicone-gel-anna-popp-01-caf31d8346874888b5195a3c09bb33d3.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Anna Popp</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-raised-scars-cimeosil-scar-and-laser-gel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Raised Scars</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cimeosil Scar and Laser Gel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cimeosil Scar and Laser Gel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_azg1SW3sc0Wrszr0YYVNAm31Uw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cimeosil-scar-and-laser-gel-ff2cca6f98cc48a69def085dfc006318.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Scent</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s water-repellent.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not going to completely flatten a scar, but reduce it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This cream had a tough job to do: Heal a keloid scar, which is a thick raised scar that forms when the body produces too much collagen during the healing process, and instead of sitting flush with skin, it elevates in a bumpy manner. We used it to treat a four-year-old 4.5-inch scar with a purple hue and noticeable red veins that appeared after surgery.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After three weeks of applying the gel twice daily, we began to notice a much more natural-looking flesh tone on the scar. There was also a decrease in the thin red vertical veining running through it. Most of all, the scar that was once a quarter of an inch above the surface of the skin had visibly flattened—not completely, but enough to make us feel ecstatic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The gel comes out in a very thick, viscose consistency. It doesn’t exactly glide, as we could feel it pull against the skin when we tried. It seemed to somehow sit on top of the skin instead of being absorbed. Running any kind of liquid over it also revealed that it’s waterproof, sealing the affected area tightly. The sensation wasn’t uncomfortable, however. Instead of absorbing like a lotion, the gel worked its magic from on top of the skin where it sat and remained for several hours without transferring onto other clothing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.49 oz <strong>| Key Ingredients: </strong>Polysiloxanes <strong>| Scented: </strong>No <strong>| Time to Results: </strong>3 weeks</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Mary Honeyman-Speichinger</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-acne-scars-cicatricure-face--body-scar-gel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Acne Scars</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cicatricure Face & Body Scar Gel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Cicatricure Face &amp;amp; Body Scar Gel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bBTSTrSDDZ5ygE0nUYSlH-6aP34=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cicatricure-Face--Body-Scar-Gel-b282cb63a6554976ad2a56f764e1ab76.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Scent</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It didn’t leave any white case, and felt rather hydrating on our face.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It required four applications a day, which was a little tedious.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re very particular with what we put on our faces, especially because the skin on our face is much more delicate than that on our body, and only a cream intentionally formulated for it should be used there. Therefore, the acne gel we chose to treat our pretty visage was this Cicatricure scar gel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After two to three years of dealing with adult acne and disrupting the healing process, we attempted to use this cream on our little acne scars that looked like speckled freckles across our cheeks, every day four times a day. Yes, it’s a lot, and we had to carry it around in our purses so as not to forget each day, but the results were worth it. We saw the darkness of the scars brighten and the indents become less prominent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for the gel itself, it comes out of the tube looking mostly clear, so it wasn’t at all noticeable once we dabbed it on. It’s smooth and silky and felt a little like applying a combination of aloe and mint on our skin. It even smelled a little minty, which is odd considering the package says it’s fragrance-free.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It took about 10 to 15 minutes to fully absorb, so we applied it as the last step on our skincare routines. Luckily, it didn’t leave a white cast or cause any irritation, just a minty fresh and moisturizing sensation. The results weren’t night and day clear, but noticeable enough to be worth it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1 oz <strong>| Key Ingredients: </strong>Glycerin, carbomer, chamomilla recutita, bergamot fruit oil, onion bulb extract, aloe vera <strong>| Scented: </strong>Yes <strong>| Time to Results: </strong>2 weeks</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-comfortable-scaraway-clear-silicone-scar-sheets></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Comfortable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ScarAway Clear Silicone Scar Sheets</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Scaraway Clear Silicone Scar Sheets" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uftuSM2pK3Ekx54XDUYj3yrjv5U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sheetz-6e402f3102c343c5be9ae862d56423f1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ScarAway</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Scent</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Despite keeping them on for a long time, we didn’t feel a thing.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The stickers can be tricky to place properly in a way they would last the full 10 days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Healing old scars is a long process, so you’re going to want a comfortable experience you don’t mind enduring for the next few months. Not only did the silicone scar sheets from Scaraway feel hydrating and invisible, but they required a single application every ten days, sparing you from adding yet another cream to your umpteen-step skincare routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It was a little tricky applying the sheet at first because it adheres quickly (and strong, as they’re intended to remain on for ten days), and one wrong movement causes it to either stick to itself or stick to the wrong part of the skin. After one failed sticker getting disposed of, we were extra careful not to waste any more of the six strips. Pro tip: peel just a corner of the backing off, place on the skin, then slowly roll the backing off as you stick it on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once on, we were impressed with how easy it was to forget it was there. The clear silicone is lightweight and hydrating and doesn’t cause any tingling sensations. It’s also see-through, so we couldn’t even see it unless we really looked. We were able to wear it through showers and swims, and the sticker remained perfectly placed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Already after one treatment, the scars on our feet caused by surgery were flattened and barely noticeable.

We had a scar on our foot, where the sticker lasted about four days due to constant rubbing against shoes. We therefore recommend this more for areas with less friction, like the belly, chest, legs, or arms.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>6 sheets, 1.5” x 3”<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Silicone <strong>| Scented: </strong>No<strong> | Time to Results: </strong>10 days</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-2 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2645 data-sizes=750px alt="A person wears a Scaraway Clear Silicone Scar Sheet on their foot" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vWiAXyehD5piVIQ-x5RRg17LgCo=/fit-in/1500x2645/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-scar-creams-test-scaraway-clear-silicone-sheets-surfina-adams-01-590d5f2e56d240568ec7220ed07a63eb.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Surfina Adams</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="A person wears a Scaraway Clear Silicone Scar Sheet on their foot" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vbr-g3eXS0uRBlm3LFJNveIFwp0=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-scar-creams-test-scaraway-clear-silicone-sheets-surfina-adams-02-d714c92674024482831a38abd79d36e4.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Surfina Adams</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-small-scars-healfast-medical-grade-silicone-scar-gel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Small Scars</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>HealFast Medical-Grade Silicone Scar Gel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="HealFast Medical-Grade Silicone Scar Gel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/VOaIhAeOegaNEldISBV5ryx49ts=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/HealFast-Medical-Grade-Silicone-Scar-Gel-6eafb208178542b0b8f46ec6b72148b6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>HealFast</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Scent</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This gel visibly flattened our scar and lightened its color.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It requires three applications a day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The older we get, the easier it is to scar, which means even that tiny papercut can have an everlasting effect on our skin. We accidentally nicked a bit of our finger in a bagel slicing incident and it healed into a bumpy scar. After using this gel, the scar visibly flattened and changed completely in color.

The gel asks to be applied three times a day, every day, which meant we had to have it on us at all times, otherwise we would forget. We began setting up timers on our phones to remind us to apply. The dedication was well worth it, though, considering how fast we saw results. Despite the package indicating it can take up to six months to see the full impact, we noticed a change as fast as one month.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The gel itself is very slick. We had to rub it in until it was completely absorbed, which took about 30 seconds on a small scar. Otherwise, it would transfer onto anything we touched. It also left a bit of a residue on the finger we used to apply it with, which needed to be washed off. Still, a tiny droplet goes a long way, so we’re confident the bottle would last us a long time, even with three applications a day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.06 oz<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Medical grade silicone <strong>| Scented: </strong>No<strong> | Time to Results: </strong>1 month</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-4 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2562 data-sizes=750px alt="A drop of HealFast Physician Formulated Medical-grade Silicone Scar Gel on a scar" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/S2zVLpx8AQNeI9GdROxgb4DNV5U=/fit-in/1500x2562/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-scar-creams-test-healfast-physician-formulated-medical-grade-silicone-gel-chole-anello-02-8bc9035aaac54083aab6b58c23332573.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Chloe Anello</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="A person holds a box of HealFast Physician Formulated Medical-grade Silicone Scar Gel" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-SbQpZiJiJXvJ3Umv0WST5pArN4=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-scar-creams-test-healfast-physician-formulated-medical-grade-silicone-gel-chole-anello-01-fea4cc082c6d409490987c26e84161b3.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Chloe Anello</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-redness-and-discoloration-rejuvaskin-rejvasil-silicone-scar-gel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Redness and Discoloration</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rejuvaskin RejûvaSil Silicone Scar Gel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rejuvaskin Rej&amp;ucirc;vaSil Silicone Scar Gel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/IxvNm3pesrTVR2-HQDUC1IKhQjc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rejvasil-silicone-scar-gel-69eae7b5f41e4418b78396f3c7d6cf47.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Scent</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>A little product goes a long way, making the bottle last a while.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It requires two to three applications a day, which was a lofty goal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you just have a little discoloration left over on your scar, but no real texture change, then this will clear that right up for you.

The sheet needed to be placed right where our pants hit, so we dealt with constant friction against the affected area, causing the stickiness to lose power more rapidly.

At first application, the watery gel slid over the area extremely smoothly, informing us that only a tiny droplet was required to cover a large area. Once on, it also tingled on the skin a little. It dries down before getting absorbed, and the whole process takes about 30 minutes (the tickling sensation lasted that entire time). After about five applications, the skin got used to the feeling and the tingling stopped, but it was still important to remember not to touch the section in order to avoid any transferring.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The scar cream required daily application once a day, which was easy to stick to. After about four weeks, the affected area peeled and we had to rub the dead skin off. Looking at our before picture then, it was evident that the dark, brownish color of the scar had lightened in shade. We continued to use the product and at the end of the testing period, were pleasantly surprised to see a scar much lighter in color, although the size of it did not shrink.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.76 oz<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Allantoin, cepalin, sodium hyaluronate, panthenol <strong>| Scented: </strong>No <strong>| Time to Results: </strong>5 weeks</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Bianca Kratky</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hydrating-mederma-pm-intensive-overnight-scar-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hydrating</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mederma PM Intensive Overnight Scar Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mederma PM Overnight Scar Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/cTjBHI44FqY93woVitBeIC1EiAc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Mederma_Product_Intensice_Overnight_Scar_Cream_622x981.png-b9723f0e25d842dc8ff355594bad5f98.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Mederma</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.6</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Scent</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It feels really good on the skin, revealing a softened surface.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It takes a while to dry, and if you don’t let it fully absorb it will transfer onto bed sheets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Scar creams can be intense, so having something that soothes and softens the skin in the process is a huge bonus.

We did notice a bit of a strong scent, which we didn’t adore, but by the time we fell asleep it was impossible to notice. It didn’t tingle or irritate the skin either.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After nightly application, we noticed the scar was no longer red or angry-looking.

In order to treat a scar on our chin, we cut one sheet up into smaller strips and got more usage out of each. The adhesive sticker was pretty easy to apply, although it was not as sticky as advertised. The box reads that you can wear it for up to 24 hours, but we felt about half of that was more accurate, especially when we wore it overnight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Still, even without the 24-7 wear, we saw significant improvement in the texture and color of the chin scar.

Still, don’t consider them a done deal, as these Boysea scar sheets did an impressive job at reversing the look of a near-five-year scar caused by a c-section.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The scar we were dealing with is a slightly raised, thin, dark-pink line on the lower belly. After leaving these sheets on day and night (the brand recommends wearing them for up to 24 hours), we saw a significant reduction in the pink color and height of the scar.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It was also very easy to use the strips. They are sectioned off so you can easily rip off a desired length without a scissor. One side is smooth and the other is extremely sticky, so placing it in the right spot on the first go was important. After a day’s wear, we were worried the sheet would leave a sticky residue on the skin, but were surprised to find no such thing. In fact, our skin felt really smooth, supple, and soft after.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We had tried other creams in the past, none of which did any good on this old scar. However, the Boysea option proved to work even on this half-decade-old marking we were ready to live with for the rest of our lives. Needless to say, we are very pleased with the results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.6’’ x 150”<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Silicone<strong> | Scented: </strong>No <strong>| Time to Results: </strong>4 weeks</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">First, we searched the internet for the best rated and most popular scar creams.

We evaluated the treatments based on how well they healed the scars, how they felt, and how easy it was to incorporate them into our routines. Only the most promising ones were recommended in this article. In creating this list, we also considered how often the scar removal products needed to be applied, their cost, as well as any positive or negative traits (additional hydration or residue transfer, for example) to give you as much information as possible when making your decision on the best scar cream for your individual scars, too.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Application process</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You may have noticed that there are several different forms of scar treatments on this list. Some, like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Biodermis Epi-Derm C-Strip Package</a> and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Rejûvaskin Scar Fx Silicone Sheeting</a>, come in the form of a sheet that you peel and stick to the affected area. Consider whether or not you are ready to leave an adhesive sticker on for (more or less) 24 hours a day, and whether the scar is located in an area where this may be difficult to do. If you are the forgetful type, these types of treatments offer you a stress-free experience as you are only required to switch out the sticker every few days, and they feel nearly invisible.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Others come in the form of a gel, but even gels vary in their application processes. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">HealFast Physician Formulated Medical-grade Silicone Scar Gel</a> asked to be used three times a day, which meant we needed to carry it around if we left the house during the day. As tedious as that may be, like the name suggests, the scar healed fast, making the time commitment rather worth it. Other gels, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Mederma Advanced Scar Gel</a>, only needed to be applied once a day, which may feel like a more universal solution.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Time to results</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Patience is a virtue, especially where scar creams are concerned. Don’t write off a cream even if you don’t see results in two weeks. Many creams inform you that it can take anywhere between eight weeks and six months to see dramatic results. Board-certified dermatologist Divya Shokeen M.D. explains that the “results will vary depending on the severity of the scar and individual factors, but noticeable improvements may be observed within a few weeks to a few months of consistent use.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Key Ingredients</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Typically, scar treatments contain “ingredients like silicone, vitamin E, and hyaluronic acid, which help to hydrate the skin, promote collagen production, and reduce inflammation,” says Dr. Shokeen. However, if you are looking for specific treatments, like treating keloids, you want to look for ingredients that help reduce not just coloring, but texture as well. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Cimeosil Scar and Laser Gel</a>, which contains polysiloxanes, or silicone, helps to flatten and soften even old scars.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to fade dark marks, board-certified dermatologist Dendy Engelman M.D. suggests looking for an option that features active ingredients such as hydroquinone, kojic acid, phytic acid, l-ascorbic acid, or glycolic acid, as they brighten the skin and promote cellular turnover to reveal younger, healthier cells, fade dark spots, and improve overall skin tone. You may need to follow your scar removal regimen with a separate product to achieve both goals.

Those that contain silicone may act to create a protective effect seal over the scar,” he explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For old scars, ingredients like allantoin and cepalin, found in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Mederma Advanced Scar Gel</a> help to soften the skin and promote new cell regrowth, which can reverse the appearance of old markings.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I avoid getting a scar?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The best way to treat a scar is to attack it at its source, meaning the minute you get a wound, start treating it correctly. This does not mean apply scar creams to an open wound, warns Dr. Shokeen. Instead, “cleanse the wound, provide a hydrating environment, and avoid sun exposure,” says Dr. Brauer. Simple moisturizers will do wonders for a wound. You want to avoid having it create a scab, as these tend to cause scarring more easily. Tend to your wound by keeping infections at bay and moisturizing it daily.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are scar creams safe on all skin types?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Shokeen confirms that scar creams are generally safe for most skin types. However, if you have any specific concerns, “it is always advisable to consult a dermatologist or conduct a patch test before using any new product.” If you know yourself to have sensitive skin, Dr. Shokeen warns that “some scar creams may contain potentially irritating ingredients, so asking your doctor for a recommendation can always be beneficial.” Dr. Brauer chimes in that “fragrance-free and alcohol-free products will suit those with sensitive skin much better.” And of course, look for scar creams with moisturizing agents, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Mederma PM Overnight Scar Cream</a>, to avoid irritation.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bianca Kratky</a> is a commerce writer with over two years of experience covering fashion and beauty products.
