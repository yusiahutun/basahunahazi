Mercury—our cosmic messenger planet—is now soaring <a href=#>through breezy and brilliant Gemini</a>. By June 12, mighty Saturn—the Great Taskmaster—also stations retrograde <a href=#>in the deep sea of Pisces</a>. With so much planetary activity taking place, we’ll notice a slightly more reflective energy beginning to take hold. After all, chatty Mercury will square off with avoidant Saturn in Pisces on June 15, raising concerns and intellectual challenges. Luckily, sweet Venus—<a href=#>our goddess of romance and attraction</a>—will help us laugh it off and smooth everything over by the end of the week, so be sure to look your best, live in the moment and prepare to socialize with intention. After all, there’s no better time to connect with others than <a href=#>during Gemini season</a>. And with a <a href=#>new moon in Gemini</a> awaiting you at the end of the week, the time to introduce yourself is now. Friendships are blossoming and ideas are growing on trees!</p><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming week, according to <a href=#>your sun</a> and/or <a href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><h2 class=hide-small><strong>How the Planets Will Affect Your Zodiac Sign This Week</strong></h2><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.6773255813953><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>This week, you can successfully solve for X.</p><p>The week begins on Sunday, June 11, with the sun in Gemini making a semisquare to Jupiter in Taurus and your house of money. Aries, you might have been working on a side business or something to bring in some passive income. And if that’s the case, you have quite a few tasks to do to maximize this thing for profits. But there’s a little bit of friction today. You’re ready to go, but others are trying to hold you back.</p><p>On Tuesday, June 13, Venus in Leo and your house of personal expression and risk-taking makes a quincunx with Saturn in Pisces. Today, procrastination is related to perfectionism. If you’re refraining from working on something, it could be because you’re afraid you won’t get it right. But if you don’t take the risk, you won’t have the data to figure out what you need to do to get the results you want. Aries, think about this in terms of an experiment.&nbsp;<a href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.6858490566038><h2>Taurus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Taurus.png><p>This week, you’re rubbing elbows with greatness.</p><p>The week begins on Sunday, June 11, with the sun in Gemini and your house of money making a semisquare to Jupiter in your own sign of Taurus. You are attracting a lot of attention today whether you like it or not. Taurus, you might receive compliments even if you don’t feel like you look your best. Someone might praise your shoes or hat when you’re trying to keep a low profile. Today, it’s possible that someone will put a microphone in your hand and push you on stage.</p><p>On Tuesday, June 13, Venus in Leo and your house of dwellings makes a quincunx to Saturn in Pisces. Today, you might need to call a repair person out to fix something, but it’s difficult to find the quality work you’re looking for. Taurus, it’s not that your standards are so rigorous; it’s just that everyone seems to be busy or running late, or they just don’t show up at all.

Gemini, it’s possible that you’re on vacation and far away from regular responsibilities. But if this isn’t the case, you want to check out. This is a good day to unplug and go camping. Or you might want to visit a shopping mall in a neighboring town. Today, you’re making yourself scarce.</p><p>On Tuesday, June 13, Venus in Leo and your house of communication makes a quincunx with Saturn in Pisces and your house of career. Gemini, a miscommunication between you and a supervisor is quite possible today. If you’re scheduled to meet, you might want to listen very carefully to what is said before you offer any comments.

Leo, you might be interested in someone, but the circumstances between the two of you make dating difficult. It’s possible there’s a big age difference, or you both work at a company that frowns on fraternization. Or maybe you live quite far apart. Right now, you might have resign yourself to talking by phone or video conference.</p><p>On Tuesday, June 13, Venus in your own sign of Leo makes a quincunx to Saturn in Pisces and your house of resources. Leo, you like to be generous (really generous), but sometimes your bank account doesn’t support it. Instead of giving someone a gift, you might want to give them your time and attention.
