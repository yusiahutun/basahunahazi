However, the pair wanted to be on the cover and asked O'Neill to push for them, but he declined.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:636e36d8-8b9a-443c-80c5-ae9adc4e5010 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d2481d9b-85cf-4845-b0e0-d74efccf5494 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e6/5by4/2024/01/17/e64fd7af7dba446cb3d0df59f57afc1d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Ed O'Neill Considered Joining The Mafia Before Heading to Hollywood</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>O'Neill elaborated on the feud to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Fox News Digital</strong></a>, saying he mishandled a couple moments.</p><p>"If I was smarter, I would have said to the two of them, 'Let me go to [creator Ron Leavitt] and talk to him. I should have done that," he told the outlet. "But instead of that, I said, 'Hey, no. This isn't for us the actors, this is for the whole show... the grips, the makeup, the hair. This makes our show have a longer life, maybe.' That was how I looked at it. I didn't give a f--k about being on the cover, I'd say 'Why don’t you leave me off the cover and say Al is stuck at work.'"</p><p>But this isn't the only blunder O'Neill has owned up to. The 77-year-old also regrets how he lashed out at Bearse for not inviting him to her wedding to businesswoman Carrie Schenken, in 2010.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d1/4by3/2024/01/22/d14beec5977e419bafaec8270f7ce779_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Everett Collection</span><p>"In those days, it was a novelty, it was new," O’Neill told the outlet --- referring to a same-sex wedding.</p><p>"She didn’t invite me to the wedding. And my feelings were hurt. And when I asked her about it, she said, 'Well, it was a tough call.' And I thought, 'Are you confusing me with Al Bundy?' I didn't say that, but that's what I felt like. 'What do you mean, you think I'm a Neanderthal, or something?' So, I was angry. If I had a do-over again, I would have said, 'Amanda, all the best. It's your call, it's your wedding. But instead, I lashed out, and I said a joke, but it was a mean joke. That's my biggest regret about that, I didn’t handle that well at all, I know that."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:19a494c1-3973-4622-87f3-f86527cc0cbb data-container-ref=toofab:article:d2481d9b-85cf-4845-b0e0-d74efccf5494 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b2/5by4/2022/05/13/b2ca904e3448423d99decfd05ffe7c51_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Married ... with Children' Revival In the Works with Original Cast</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Bearse was asked about her relationship with O'Neill during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>a Q&A session</strong></a> at a fan convention in 2020.</p><p>"Are we filming this?" she responded to a fan, but remained coy about how she feels about her former co-star. "I follow the Thumper [from <strong>Bambi</strong>] rule. If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all."</p><p>However, she did share that, "he was not happy toward the end of the series, so that affected everything. And that's really why the show didn't really go off the air with a big finale."</p><p>O'Neill played head of the family Al Bundy alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Katey Sagal's</strong></a> Peggy Bundy on the Fox series from 1987 to 1997. The show documented the Bundy's working-class life with their two children, Kelly (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Christina Applegate</strong></a>) and Bud (David Faustino). Bearse portrayed their neighbor Marcy D'Arcy throughout all 11 seasons.</p><a id=gallery-link-11661ebe-010a-4681-9c57-79baf461ca46 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:11661ebe-010a-4681-9c57-79baf461ca46 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:d2481d9b-85cf-4845-b0e0-d74efccf5494 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/80/4by3/2024/01/29/80391243a7cc4217879c99dba532a9f7_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pma3FfmrFuu82eoKWkXZuytrCMppirqpmasW7DyK2fZpuYnrmlvsSnZJynXajBor6MmqSappSWeqOxwKuqnmc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./beyonce-nicki-minaj-twerk-party-swimwear-coachella-feeling-music-video-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nicki Minaj hits at Tyga in 'Pervert 17' shirt in Feeling Myself video">&larr;
