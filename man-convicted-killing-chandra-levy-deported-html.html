suggesting that Chandra had been in the area when she went missing.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Authorities announced that July there was a good chance that Chandra's body might never be found, and though Condit was cleared as a suspect his political career never recovered and he was defeated in the California primary the following March.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Two months after that, in May 2002, a man found human bones and a skull in Washington's Rock Creek Park, where police had previously searched for Chandra's body.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The park's administrative office was also one of the last searches on Condit's computer the day that Chandra went missing.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Her death was determined to be a homicide soon after, and a month after her skull and bones were found private investigators hired by her parents also found her shin bones less than 100 feet from where her remains had initially been discovered that May.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>It was months before the discovery of Chandra's body however that Guandique was introduced as a suspect, when a prison informant said he had spoke about murdering Chandra.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Guandique had also been accused of assaulting two other female joggers in the park.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He was behind bars at the time on drug charges but was never formally charged in the death of Chandra and her case went cold until 2006 when it was reopened by the city's new police chief.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>After a three-year investigation, Guandique was charged with Chandra's murder in 2009 and later indicted on six counts including kidnapping, first-degree murder committed during a kidnapping, attempted first-degree sexual abuse, first-degree murder committed during a sexual offense, attempted robbery, and first-degree murder committed during a robbery.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He was convicted in November 2010 and sentenced to 60 years in prison before the
