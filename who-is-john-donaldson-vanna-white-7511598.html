"I so wanted to be pregnant and have a baby, so then when I finally got pregnant, I wanted to tell the world immediately," she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>told PEOPLE</a> in 2019, recalling the "devastating" news.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But White recalled "good news" too, sharing that she "was able to get pregnant again and had two beautiful, healthy children." She and Santo Pietro welcomed a son named Nicholas in 1994 and a daughter named Giovanna "Gigi" in 1997.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, White has been open about her past relationships, particularly the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tragedies she's faced</a> and how fans, family and faith have helped her cope. In 1986, White lost her then-fiancé,&nbsp;Young and the Restless actor John Gibson, who was killed in a plane crash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I heard from so many people who had shared the same experience of losing someone instantly in an accident, and that really helped me," White told PEOPLE. "I didn't feel like I was alone. Because when something like that happens, you immediately think you're the only one."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Outside of her romantic relationships, White has also maintained a decades-long friendship with her Wheel of Fortune co-host&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Pat Sajak</a> over the past 40 years.&nbsp;White <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>recently told PEOPLE</a> that "it is" hard to imagine a world where neither herself nor Sajak is hosting the series.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think when Merv Griffin chose both of us, 40 and 41 years ago, he saw something between us — a brother-sister type relationship," she said. "And I think that is kind of what it is. He saw that we would be able to get along, and we do.

White met the real estate developer when a friend brought him to one of her barbecues.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I remember looking at him and thinking, 'He's really cute,'" she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>told PEOPLE</a> with a laugh.
