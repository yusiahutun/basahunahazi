However, StyleCaster may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.</p><p>It used to be that men’s haircuts consisted of a few barbershop specials but lately guys have been getting seriously creative with their manes. In fact, there are some <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=1616834>men’s hair trends for 2024</a> that are downright cool and utterly attractive. Why? Because they’re all about embracing your natural texture. Curls, waves, afros —&nbsp;they’re all hotter than ever.</p><p>To find out what trends guys should try this season, we chatted with some of the biggest hairstylists and groomers in the game. They told us what their <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1624223 rel="noreferrer noopener">celebrity</a> and influencer clients are asking for and how the everyday guy can get in on the trend. Keep reading for all the inspo you need as the weather gets cooler and you’re ready to try a new look. Don’t worry —&nbsp;some of these are totally doable.</p><p>The biggest takeaway? Creativity rules. So, if you usually use gel to control <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=1392950>frizz</a>, let the frizz out this season. If you usually buzz off your poker-straight hair, try a ’90s middle part to play it up. Either way, have some fun with it.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.7874762808349><h2>Rockstar Vibe</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1797989182.jpg><p>In 2023, guys favored for more structured hairstyles but Taylor Hooker, Marketing Manager and Grooming Expert at <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/pmc_0aaa4_stylecaster?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3Dt1ZX7%2A4ybQA%26mid%3D1237%26u1%3DSC--%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nordstrom.com%252Fbrands%252Fjack-black--1064&p=https%3A%2F%2Fstylecaster.com%2Flists%2Fmens-hair-trends%2F&ref=pmcTrackonomicsReferrer&event_type=click">Jack Black</a>, sees that changing in 2024. “I think we’re going to see a lot more experimentation with length,” she says. “We’ll continue to see the mullet and euro-mullet dominate, but the length on top may be more emphasized with a 70s/80s rockstar vibe. We’ll also see hair that’s tight on the sides but longer on top and permed.” He even sees a possible return to the man bun.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://booksy.com/en-us/113354_sapia-the-barber_barber-shop_15980_clearwater?do=invite&_branch_match_id=1008112092853333476&utm_medium=merchant_customer_invite&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXT07J0UvKz88urtRLzs%2FVz8ozjsryjTJNrkwCADOO7EQiAAAA">Tina Sapia</a>, Booksy Ambassador and Owner of Sapia’s Barbershop in Clearwater, FL., agrees that longer hair will reign supreme. “We can anticipate longer looks, namely hairstyles that require an artist’s hand or someone who has experience cutting longer hair and crafting cuts specifically for each customer,” she says. “Gone are the days of the standard shag or ‘<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1344194 rel="noreferrer noopener">wolf cut</a>’ — clients are coming into the shop with an ideal image in mind, and then as experts, we work to create the look that’s best suited for them.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.97799174690509><h2>Natural Texture</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1470029349.jpg><p>“We are seeing the evolution of classic hairstyles with a modern twist,” says <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.instagram.com/jtraviswalters/?hl=en">J-Travis Walters</a>, National Corporate Education Manager for Schwarzkopf Professional. “Haircuts like the quiff and pompadour are still popular but men are focusing more on embracing their natural texture and not looking for the ‘perfect’ style. This is great because a stylist/barber can work with clients to create the best look for their facial structure and natural hair texture so the style can be recreated at home and not just the day of the haircut. Different lengths will give men more flexibility and believe it or not, the man bun is set to make a comeback as well.” You heard it here first.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.9176090468498><h2>Buzzcut</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-859285166.jpg><p>When the hair starts getting too long, guys are going to buzz off their stands in the summer, Sapia says. Or, if you’re Harry Styles, even before that. It’s a style Matrix Brand Ambassador, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.instagram.com/castillo_13/?hl=en">Castillo Bataille</a>, loves. “It’s our all-time favorite classic and it’s coming back but this time in color,” he says. “A great way to make your buzz cut modern is by adding some bleach and color. Mix some Matrix Light Master Pre Bonded with 20 vol developer and lift that color. Don’t forget to tone using the Tonal Control line in 9vv for that very cool blonde. Or pop on some color for a unique touch.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.625><h2>Professional Mullets</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1251915328.jpg><p>Mini mullet, long mullet, curly 4C hair or straight — it’s all hot for 2024. “I’ve seen a lot of textured mullets, to textured mohawks, along with textured combovers and fades,” says <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/jaimeecutzbarberstudio/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jaime Castañeda</a>, Owner of Jaimeecutz Barber Studio in <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.solasalonstudios.com/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sola Salons</a>. “The keyword is TEXTURE! Everyone wants volume and movement looks using matte products and I’m here for it. I feel it brings a newer trendy challenge to a barber’s creativity. It allows us to test our shear work and elevate our already sharp skills. And, adding texture to finer hair types, allows us to explore additional service offerings.”</p><p>Reid Ryan, Founder and CEO of men’s grooming brand <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/pmc_0aaa4_stylecaster?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D87443X1593552%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3DSC--%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.hardworkinggentlemen.com%252F&p=https%3A%2F%2Fstylecaster.com%2Flists%2Fmens-hair-trends%2F&ref=pmcTrackonomicsReferrer&event_type=click">Hardworking Gentlemen</a>, sees mullets becoming more low key — even good for a professional setting. “We are seeing a lot of mid-length styles with some extra length in the back, not quite a mullet but more professional,” he says. “This look works great with both straight and curly hair, think early 2000s styles with more of a middle part. I like this look as it is both professional and casual, looks very natural and can help cover any hairline concerns.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9.496><h2>Bleached Buzz Cut</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bleached-hair.png><p>“It’s our all-time favorite classic and it’s coming back but this time in color.

He recommends mixing Matrix Light Master Pre-Bonded with 20 volume developer to lift the color and Matrix’s Tonal control line in 9vv for that very cool blonde. “Or pop on some color for a unique touch. I see violets, lavenders, and purples being a hit this fall,” he added.</p><p>And when your natural hair color starts growing through the bleach, well, you’re rocking another trend for fall, said <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/jame5t7/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">James Taylor</a>, International Master Educator for Balmain Hair.</p><p>“Stand out from the crowd and elevate the faded look that is dominating men’s hair at the minute with bleach,” he said. “This looks great when it’s first done but will look ultra hip once growing out, as this will add dimension and contrast as your natural hair comes through.”</p><p>Keep the blonde hue fresh and hydrated at home with Balmain Hair Couture’s Illuminating White Pearl Shampoo ($51 at <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/pmc_0aaa4_stylecaster?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2FckrVeBE56Om&p=https%3A%2F%2Fstylecaster.com%2Flists%2Fmens-hair-trends%2F&ref=pmcTrackonomicsReferrer&event_type=click">Saks Fifth Avenue</a>) and Mask ($80 at <a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/pmc_0aaa4_stylecaster?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2FckrVf05tyvR&p=https%3A%2F%2Fstylecaster.com%2Flists%2Fmens-hair-trends%2F&ref=pmcTrackonomicsReferrer&event_type=click" rel=nofollow>Saks Fifth Avenue</a>) once a week.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.7922185430464><h2>Tons of Texture</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/textured-hair.png><p>“Men are embracing their natural curls and in salons [and even] asking for perming services to create movement in their hair,” Taylor said. “Whether it’s long, short, or medium length, ask for the shape to be cut flatter or square to keep it masculine. Keep the style soft with movement by retailing the length or adding a contrast of textures by carving out the edges.”</p><p>To get TikTok star Noah Beck’s look, “brush it back or wear it forwards by scrunching the hair (not brushing) and allow it to dry naturally or defuse on a low speed alternating between a hot and cool setting,” he added.

Free.Hold can be applied to both wet or dry hair with natural shine and flexible hold, ideal for the guy who likes to play around with their hair all day long.”</p><p>Kevin.Murphy Bedroom.Hair is also great to use as a finishing spray. “Just like the name, it creates a really nice texture into the hair, shine, and all-day hold,” he said. “Spray Bedroom.Hair as a finishing product, or wet set the hair for the guy on the go. Once the hair is dry, you can dishevel and mess the hair up with your hands to create that lived-in look with incredible hold and shine.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.5637583892617><h2>Mid-Length Hair</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mid-length-hair.png><p>“Mid-length hair is coming back and whether you’re pushing it forward or sticking it back, keep it clean and short on the side,” Bataille said. “I’ll still be keeping length on top as it will always be the safe move.” Keep the look “dapper” with a pomade or paste throughout the hair, such as Matrix Over Achiever 3-in-1 Cream Paste Wax ($22 at <a data-pmc-sp-product=ae70ac4d0cfeeca33656c549f12fbdb4 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Matrix Styling Over Achiever 3-in-1 Wax | For Smoothing & Structuring Hair | Provides Long Lasting Texture & Grip | Reworkable Hold | Spreads Like Cream Pomade| For All Hair Types | 1.7 Oz","price":"23.00","id":"B0BKTNWTZR","category":"Gels"},"id":1630385,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon</a> ). “This gives a lived-in style with smooth hold,” he added.</p><p>Olsen likes his mid-length styles to have a “surfer grunge” look. “The best way to style this type of haircut starts with not overly washing your hair too much,” he said. “You want to maintain some sort of grit or texture in your hair that clumps and brings your curl or wave pattern together, for that ‘out of the ocean’ look.” To fake it, reach for <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://kevinmurphy.com.au/us/en/km/products-/by-benefit-/texture-/HAIR-RESORT.html>Kevin.Murphy Hair.Resort Beach Texturiser And Curl Enhancer</a>. “It’s the ultimate surfer dude’s product to create a natural finish, shine, and texture to enhance a beach tousled look,” he said.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratforKvv4yhmKKqXam%2FprrDrGY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./psychology-behind-sexual-dreams.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Psychology Behind Sexual Dreams">&larr;
