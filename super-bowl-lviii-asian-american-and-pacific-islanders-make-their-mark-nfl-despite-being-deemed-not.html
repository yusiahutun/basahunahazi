But for nearly a century, they have had a presence on the NFL field.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And for decades, football has been a mainstay in Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities – yielding a fair share of star athletes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many current and former athletes of AAPI heritage agreed that such misconceptions have mostly faded. Increasingly, major athletes have been able to amplify their culture on a public stage and be embraced.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The League sent a similar message earlier this week in Las Vegas when the NFL and the Las Vegas Super Bowl LVIII Host Committee recruited more than 15 Asian-American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander organisations, including The Asian-American Foundation, to put on an inaugural Lunar New Year Night Market for media.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Manumalo Muasau, a New York Giants linebacker for two seasons starting in 2012, was among those at the Night Market. The 33-year-old now serves as a mental performance consultant for the Tennessee Titans and for private clients.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/10/1ae071a1-19df-4efc-a7ad-9c80bc05e411_6ed34c1f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He grew up admiring Pittsburgh Steelers safety Troy Polamalu, a fellow Samoan American who had long locks like him. Now, he happily watches young pros like Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa honouring his Polynesian heritage in a way players before him were likely unable to.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When they’re walking into the locker room and all the media’s there … for Tua, he’s in the Samoan community and the cultural attire is an ie faitaga,” Muasau said, referring to a formal, rectangular cloth worn like a kilt or wraparound skirt. “So he’s displaying his culture during that pregame game day fit.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For most of his life, Muasau went by his middle name Jake because he thought it sounded more “American” and was easier for people to say. But in 2017, he decided to embrace his full name.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That’s an experience that many of our AAPI communities can also relate to,” Muasau said. “My first couple of years in graduate school, when I was learning to really reintegrate my Samoan identity, part of that transition for me was introducing myself as my first name.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Growing up Asian and black American or “Blasian” in Orange County, California, Remigio didn’t feel a sense of belonging. His neighbours and classmates were mostly white; he was called racial slurs and often questioned about his hair and skin colour.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Taylor Swift can fly from Tokyo to boyfriend’s NFL game on time: Japan embassy</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As an adult, he understands that that behaviour isn’t about him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They’re probably dealing with more difficulties than they’re putting off, which is why they’re acting that way,” Remigio said. “Just people in general who act like that, I don’t really give them my time of day.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The relationship between AAPI people and a lot of Western sports dates back to colonialism in Hawaii, the Philippines and other parts of Asia, said Constancio Arnaldo Jnr, an assistant professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Historically, in US sports, Asian-American men have been treated as outsiders and their masculinity questioned.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Asian Americans have always in many ways used sports as a form of American belonging, as a form of identity,” Arnaldo said. “When we think about race, it’s very much along black and white lines. Asian Americans are always kind of troubling and in this liminal space of a black-white binary, even in sports.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Arnaldo, who co-edited the book Asian-American Sporting Cultures, said it makes business sense for the NFL to try to appeal to Asian-American spectators. Football has long been a source of pride across Polynesian communities including Samoans to Tongans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The NBA and Major League Baseball, they actually have dedicated Filipino heritage nights,” Arnaldo said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/10/2fec3e25-260f-418a-b4b3-50db9661e2dd_d2b070b5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With expanded representation though, anti-Asian racism still lingers. In 2021, former player and assistant coach Eugene Chung said he was told in an interview for a coaching job that Asian Americans were “not the right minority” to lead the NFL, even though the league’s policy recognises them as a marginalised group.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Korean American, who was only the third Asian pro athlete at the start of his career in the 1990s, accused the NFL of brushing him off.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the NFL’s next season, there will be nine coaches of colour, the most in the league’s history. But none of them are Asian or Pacific Islander.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the 2023 racial and gender report card from The Institute for Diversity and Ethics In Sport, two-thirds of all NFL players (66.7 per cent) are minorities, 53.5 per cent of whom are black. Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders are only 1.8 per cent of players, a slight increase from 1.5 per cent in 2022. Asian players only represented 0.1 per cent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are at least two dozen NFL players of Asian or Pacific Islander descent, according to AMAZN HQ, an online hub curating news on Asians and Asian Americans in sports. Among them is Atlanta Falcons place-kicker and South Korea-born Younghoe Koo and Minnesota Vikings safety Camryn Bynum, who, like Remigio, is both black and Filipino. The two men were teammates at California in Berkeley.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When it comes to cultural pride, Bynum has worn his heart, and a Philippines flag decal, on his sleeve. He has called his home country “the best place in the world.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fans were rooting for his wife when she finally obtained a visa in November to travel to the US from the Philippines. On Instagram he posted a video of himself bringing home-made chicken adobo, lumpia and other Filipino foods to his teammates’ homes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mqKyYmr9uv8%2Boqa1nkafBqq%2FLnmZsamVmg3OFjqysqZ2iYq%2Bww8tmo6%2BhmZ56or%2FImqVmmZ2av6qvwKdkmqaUYr2ir8ifoJxlmai5orrDnqmsZZ2WuKZ506Gcoqpdoq6zt4ynnaVllJrAsbXTnmSbnZmjtG6wxJ6knpxdo7y1</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./celebrity-selfies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celebrities Who Post the Most Selfies">&larr;
