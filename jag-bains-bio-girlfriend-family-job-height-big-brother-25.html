Jag Bains, whom we are about to discuss, is one of the contestants. He is the one making history, as the first Sikh-Punjabi contestant to ever appear on a Big Brother show.</p><p>Jag is a massive Big Brother fan and claimed of having a solid strategy before heading into the house. Keep reading and find out more about his journey on a reality show and about his life outside of Big Brother’s house.</p><h3><strong>Jag Bains On Big Brother 25</strong></h3><p>Jag talked to Parade about the “incredible” honor known as Big Brother 25 in his pregame interview. Most of all, he focused on the topic of representing his Sikh community. He said he does it so wearing a turban every day. Coming on this show for him was basically to be who he is, and represent not only himself but his family, people, and his community as they mean the world to him.</p><p>Before going on the show, Jag also had already figured out his strategy to win the game. He went inside thinking he is willing to do what it takes to go to the end. He told Parade he want to do as much as he can to keep himself safe and have some close allies who can take him with them to the end. Because he said he would not like to play the lone wolf game. That way, he was planning to make it to the end, by being loyal to his closest allies and building their trust.</p><p>Like Jag Bains, other housemates creating history this season are the first Australian contestant, Bowie Jane, and the first Deaf contestant, Matt Kloltz.</p><h3><strong>Jag Bains Job</strong></h3><p>Jag Bains’s occupation is a truck company owner, according to his CBS bio. In addition to this, he also works in real estate with his brother as his partner. Jointly, they even have a business account on Instagram for their collaborative real estate venture.</p><p>However, inside Big Brother‘s house, he said he is going to lie about it all. He told Parade that he is keeping his trades as an entrepreneur and a real estate agent a secret from the other houseguest. And instead, he said he is dissembling to be a substitute teacher and a Special Olympics coach. Fortunately, it won’t be all lie as Jag has done both of these on the side.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Jag Bains Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Jag Bains reportedly had below $400K net worth as of 2023.</p><p>On his LinkedIn, Jag also described himself as an avid learner who loves to travel, partake in outdoor activities, and find adventures along the way. He also boasted about having experience in consulting, non-profit work, the insurance industry, marketing research, and operations management at local firms.</p><p>Between 2016 and 2020, he studied Bachelor of Business Administration – BBA, Management Information Systems and Marketing Analytics at the University of Washington – Michael G. Foster School of Business. Even prior (2012 – 2016), he went to Omak High School.</p><h3><strong>Jag Bains Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>Jag Bains is most likely.
