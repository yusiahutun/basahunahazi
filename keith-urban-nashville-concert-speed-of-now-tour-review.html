The&nbsp;twists and turns of a nearly 30-song set list helped his two-and-a-half hour show pass quickly. If you took a bathroom break or ducked out for a refreshment, you probably missed something you'd never seen before.</p><p>Appearances by <a href=#>Luke Combs</a> and an unknown Lower Broadway honky-tonk singer,&nbsp;plus a tribute to <a href=#>Loretta Lynn</a>,&nbsp;are the moments fans will remember, if only because so many of the other electrifying&nbsp;highlights&nbsp;are more difficult to describe. Heavy synthesizers on "Kiss a Girl," the&nbsp;additional tortured lyrics to "You'll Think of Me" and the extended version of the under-appreciated "God Whispered Your Name" deserve as much attention. But what is there to say, other than those moments were&nbsp;"awesome!"?</p><p>An album cut named "Tumbleweed" (with notes of Ram Jam's "Black Betty") set the tempo before Urban and his tight five-piece band played "Days Go By" like it was the encore. The singer let the crowd know he planned on tributing the journey from Lower Broadway's honky-tonks to Bridgestone Arena on this night, and an unknown artist named&nbsp;Kayley Green proved his point. How unknown is Green? We couldn't even find a digital footprint to verify the spelling of her name, but thankfully our friends on Twitter steered us to <a href=#>her platform</a>.</p><p>Few things are more satisfying in life and country music than seeing someone rise up to meet a moment, and that's what she did during "Independence Day." The <a href=#>Martina McBride</a> cover is often used to showcase vocal prowess, but Green's voice added a little warble without sacrificing power. She was tremendous.</p><p>So too was Combs, who joined Urban on seven songs — and two very extended solo breaks — later. Once again, Urban was happy to step back and play acoustic guitar as the younger signer performed his hit "When It Rains It Pours." Then, they teamed up for Urban's <a href=#>Eric Church</a> duet "Raise 'Em Up" before&nbsp;Combs, a&nbsp;new father, left the stage.</p><p>Seemingly every song came with a wrinkle for those who might have been tempted to check Twitter&nbsp;before the second chorus.&nbsp;Experimental solos during "Long Hot Summer" and "You Look Good in My Shirt" were a fascinating reminder that playing guitar really well is still really, really cool. A <a href=#>John Denver</a> cover led into Urban's own "Better Life." "Somebody Like You" became the Lion King song, "In the jungle, the mighty jungle ..."&nbsp;Some&nbsp;people&nbsp;make a living — and sometimes even sign recording contracts — because of their ability to keep a TikTok audience glued to a video for longer than 10 seconds, but it's Urban, age 54, who is showing everyone how that translates to the stage.</p><p>Every one of these deviations did not work equally well, and if there's a criticism to be made, it's that the singer spent more time explaining than usual. This writer did take a refreshment break during the portion of Urban's show&nbsp;where he lets his band take the microphone (I'm not sure what I missed, but it sounded wild and amazing, and when I returned there was a&nbsp;fresh energy in section 106).</p><p>Urban paused during the show's first hour to honor Loretta Lynn, who <a href=#>died on Tuesday</a> (Oct. 4) at age 90. "Blue Eyed Kentucky Girl" and "You're Lookin' at Country" — performed solo on acoustic — were&nbsp;fine selections for him, and the singer didn't linger too long on the sad occasion. It was just enough to say thank you, something the hometown crowd appreciated.</p><p>The Speed of Now Tour has nine dates remaining, through Nov. 5 in Minnesota. <a href=#>Ingrid Andress</a> and <a href=#>Tyler Hubbard</a> opened the show with&nbsp;their mix of hit songs, album cuts and covers. This&nbsp;is Hubbard's first time opening a tour since the early days of <a href=#>Florida Georgia Line</a>, and he proved more than willing to do the hard work of warming up a crowd for the night's star.</p><h3>Keith Urban's Nashville Speed of Now Tour Set List:</h3><p>“Tumbleweed” with shades of “Black Betty” by Ram Jam<br>“Days Go By”<br>“John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16”<br>“Wild Hearts”<br>“Kiss a Girl”<br>“Independence Day” (Martina McBride Cover, with Kaylee Green singing)<br>“We Were Us” (With Green)<br>“Blue Eyed Kentucky Girl” (Loretta Lynn Tribute)<br>“You’re Lookin’ at&nbsp;Country” (Loretta Lynn Tribute)<br>“Brown Eyes Baby”<br>“Long Hot Summer”<br>“Never Comin’ Down”<br>“Somewhere&nbsp;in My Car”<br>“God Whispered Your Name”<br>“When It Rains It Pours” (Luke Combs cover, with Luke Combs singing)<br>“Raise ‘Em Up” (With Combs)<br>“You Look Good&nbsp;in My Shirt”<br>“One Too Many” (Pink appears via video)<br>“Thank God I’m a Country Boy” / “Better Life” (Medley from second stage)<br>“You’ll Think of Me” (From second stage)<br>“Somebody Like You” / “In the Jungle”<br>“Blue Ain’t Your Color”<br>“The Fighter” (Carrie Underwood appears via video)<br>“Wasted Time”</p><p><strong>Encore</strong><br>“Stupid Boy”</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Keith Urban + Nicole Kidman's Luxurious Tennessee Farmhouse</h2><p>Keith Urban and Nicole Kidman were living it up in their 5,086-square-foot, 4-bedroom farmhouse in Franklin, Tenn., a rural community 30 minutes&nbsp;outside of Nashville. The house is beautifully well-appointed. The master bedroom features a very large walk-in closet, and the gated, 35-acre property also includes a gym, recreation rooms, an office and a three-car garage, as well as a utility barn. The couple sold their rural farmhouse in 2018 for $2.7 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJ2ZqbVuwdGbmKdlnpbAqcLIpaOeZZOku6Sx0a1krKiVmrFuu8VmpaivXam8tr6Mq5yvoZWsfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lee-majors.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lee Majors Biography">&larr;
