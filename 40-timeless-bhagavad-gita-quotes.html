Upon hearing the misgivings about the justice of killing hundreds of people, Arjuna is overwhelmed. He expresses his scruples, guilts and questions to Krishna, the charioteer. It is Krishna’s reply the Gita revolves around.&nbsp;And if not the entire Gita, some of these Bhagavad Gita quotes are worth giving a read.</p><p>Krishna helps Arjuna overcome his feelings and do his duties as a man born in the class of warriors.&nbsp;</p><p>The wisdom the Bhagavad Gita imparts transcends the quantum reality, and helps man to survive in his reality. Undoubtedly, the Gita is a source of strength, inspiration, motivation and so much more to people across the world. Every word Krishna utters has a deeper meaning to life and teaches us to live a life of fulfilment.&nbsp;</p><p>Comprehending the entire Bhagavad Gita is a sacred task. It will require a chunk of your time and complete concentration. But, finding solace is not a mountain of a task. These timeless Bhagavad Gita quotes will help you navigate through life with a fresh perspective!&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Bhagavad Gita Quotes On Self-Realization and Peace</h3><p>Conquering ones thoughts is the ultimate road to self-discovery. If in life you are at cross roads with self, these Bhagavad Gita quotes<strong> </strong>are sure to help you through the toughest of the storms.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. “For one who has conquered his mind, a mind is best of friends, but for one who has failed to do so, a mind is the greatest enemy.”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1.1.-On-Self-Realization-and-Peace-Source-asanaathome.jpg><p><strong>2. “Happiness from the senses seems like nectar initially, but it is bitter as poison in the end.”</strong></p><p><strong>3. “Set thy heart upon thy work, but never on its reward.”</strong></p><p><strong>4. “He who is content with whatever comes, without attachment, not disappointed when he gets nothing, is wise.”</strong></p><p><strong>5. “Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint, and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind.”</strong></p><p><strong>6. “As a strong wind sweeps away a boat on the water, even one of the roaming world of the senses on which the mind focuses can carry away a man’s intellect.”</strong></p><p><strong>7. “One who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, is intelligent among men.”</strong></p><p><strong>8. “When meditation is mastered, the mind is unwavering like the flame of a lamp in a windless place.”</strong></p><p><strong>9. “There is neither this world nor the world beyond nor happiness for the one who doubts.”</strong></p><p><strong>10. “A person can rise through the efforts of his own mind; or draw himself down in the same manner. Because each person is his own friend or enemy.”</strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>On Duty, Action, & Detachment</h3><p>Often times in life, the fruit of the labour seems sweeter than the labour. It is this delusion and the want for more that gets us in troubles unknown. Caught up in the intricacies of life, we often forget to do something as a duty, and are held hostage by the rewards. These Bhagavad Gita quotes will change your perspective and help you understand the importance of duty, action and detachment.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. “Perform your obligatory duty because action is indeed better than inaction.”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1.2.-Source-learnreligions.jpg><p><strong>2. “One who performs his duty without attachment, surrendering the results unto the Supreme Lord, is unaffected by sinful action.”</strong></p><p><strong>3. “The wise should work without attachment, for the welfare of the society.”</strong></p><p><strong>4. “You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions.”</strong></p><p><strong>5. “Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer or give away, and whatever austerities you perform – do that, O son of Kunti, as an offering to Me.”</strong></p><p><strong>6. “When your intellect transcends the mire of delusion, then you will attain to dispassion of what has been heard and what is yet to be heard.”</strong></p><p><strong>7. “Actions do not cling to me because I am not attached to their results. Those who understand this and practice it live in freedom.”</strong></p><p><strong>8. “As the ignorant perform their duties with attachment to results, the learned may similarly act, but without attachment, for the sake of leading people on the right path.”</strong></p><p><strong>9. “Let your aim be the good of all. Then carry out your task in life with an unswerving devotion to truth, refusing to yield to selfish desires or to the errors of human nature.”</strong></p><p><strong>10. “One who is not disturbed by happiness and distress and is steady in both is certainly eligible for liberation.”</strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>On Path To Spiritual Wisdom And Enlightenment</h3><p>He is the creator, the one who is everywhere, and in everything. Reality eludes us from Him. But a truly wise man is someone who knows the joys of surrendering, who knows everything happens for a reason, and who finds true happiness within himself. These Bhagavad Gita quotes on enlightenment and spiritual wisdom will draw you closer to the lord and help you be the best version of yourself.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. “One who has wisdom and discernment is always calm and collected; such a person is in true knowledge.”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1.3.-Sourcebhagavad-gita.us_.jpg><p><strong>2. “The truly wise mourn neither for the living nor for the dead.”</strong></p><p><strong>3. “There is nothing in the world as purifying as knowledge; one who has attained purity of heart through prolonged practice of karma yoga automatically sees the light of truth in the self in course of time.”</strong></p><p><strong>4. “When you move amidst the world of sense, free from attachment and aversion alike, there comes the peace in which all sorrows end, and you live in the wisdom of the self.”</strong></p><p><strong>5. “A person is said to be established in self-realization and is called a yogi when he is fully satisfied by virtue of acquired knowledge and realization.”</strong></p><p><strong>6. “He who is able to resist the force of desire and anger before he quits his body is a yogi and is happy.”</strong></p><p><strong>7. “The disunited mind is far from wise; how can it meditate? How can it be at peace? When you know no peace, how can you know joy?”</strong></p><p><strong>8. “When a person responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were his own, he has attained the highest state of spiritual union.”</strong></p><p><strong>9. “This divine wisdom is a direct perception of the truth, much superior to any indirect knowledge of the scriptures or hearsay.”</strong></p><p><strong>10. “He who sees me everywhere and sees everything in me will not be lost to me, and I will not be lost to him.”</strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>On Effort, Persistence and Realization of Reality</h3><p>It is always said that consistency and efforts will lead you to a life of happiness and fulfilment. But at times, you feel lost with the efforts you put into achieving something. However, Bhagavad Gita teaches us to not expect and keep doing what we are doing. These <a href=# rel=noopener>Bhagavad Gita</a> quotes will pump you up with the motivation to do better things and wait for better results!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. “You have the right to work but never to the fruit of work.”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1.4.-9Source-scientificdiary.jpg><p><strong>2. “It is better to strive in one’s own dharma than to succeed in the dharma of another.”</strong></p><p><strong>3. “A disciplined mind brings happiness.”</strong></p><p><strong>4. “The wise unify their consciousness and abandon attachment to the fruits of action.”</strong></p><p><strong>5. “Sever the ignorant doubt in your heart with the sword of self-knowledge. Observe your discipline. Arise.”</strong></p><p><strong>6. “Those who are motivated only by desire for the fruits of action are miserable, for they are constantly anxious about the results of what they do.”</strong></p><p><strong>7. “When a person is devoted to something with complete faith, I unify his faith in that.”</strong></p><p><strong>8. “Reshape yourself through the power of your will; never let yourself be degraded by self-will.”</strong></p><p><strong>9. “Man is made by his belief. As he believes, so he is.”</strong></p><p><strong>10. “The ignorant work for their own profit, the wise work for the welfare of the world.”</strong></p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim-0 has-background-dim"></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Shivaji-Maharaj-Featured-Image-copy.jpg><h4 class="wp-block-heading alignwide has-medium-font-size">17 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Quotes personifying his Genius</h4><p class=has-small-font-size>In this blog, we are coming up with the 17 best&nbsp;Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj&nbsp;quotes you must read.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZIFxedOipJ6klajAbq7Hmp6arpGZeqi105pkqq2fqbK0</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hailey-bieber-rhode-phone-case-available-to-buy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hailey Bieber's viral Rhode phone case is finally available to buy">&larr;
