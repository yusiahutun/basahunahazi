The singer has primary custody of their two children, River Rose, nine, and Remington, seven, but she still must pay Brandon $45,601 a month in child support.&nbsp;</p><p id=eixzjMiiHvJ data-wc=30>Kelly was also ordered to pay Brandon $150,000 a month in spousal support, although this was later lowered to $115,000 a month, which she must pay until January 31, 2024.&nbsp;</p><p id=eOs45whmFoH data-wc=50>Aside from money, Brandon was also allowed to keep the former couple's "farm cattle, livestock, stock dogs, and horses," as well as several cars and snowmobiles, a golf simulator, and expensive watches from Patek Philippe. Kelly, meanwhile, reportedly retained ownership of the family pets, multiple cars, and a flight simulator.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fc12db7e5a79-kelly-clarkson-brandon-blackstock-kids.jpg><p id=eBlwgB3P8O data-wc=32>She also <a class=hm-link href=#>regained ownership of her Montana ranch,</a> which is valued at $17.8 million, in June 2022, although <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">according to court documents</a>, Brandon was given a five percent share of the property.&nbsp;</p><h2>What has Kelly Clarkson said about her divorce settlement?&nbsp;</h2><p id=e2xcN1wI5m data-wc=43>Kelly appeared to call out Brandon's dependency on her finances in her song '' in which she sings: "Sure, you can have the towels. You can take my money. Drag my name 'round town. I don't mind, I changed it anyway."&nbsp;</p><p id=eZ0lowg8JtA data-wc=34>She also made some telling lyric changes during her cover of Gayle's song '', which she performed on her show, in March, and again during her recent Las Vegas residency.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cbe1660d7cdf-gettyimages-911509030.jpg><p id=edhvg6QvVRe data-wc=44>She sang: "abcde [expletive] you, and your dad, and the fact that you got half, and my broken heart, turn that [expletive] into art. [Expletive] you, and your view from the valley I bought too, everybody but your dogs, you can all [expletive] off."&nbsp;</p><p id=eqOw_1jN7_ data-wc=34>The change was an obvious departure from the original words, which are usually: "[Expletive] you and your mom and your sister and your job and your broke-ass car and that [expletive] you call art."&nbsp;</p><h2>What has Kelly Clarkson said about her divorce?&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8441aa8f7dc2-kelly-clarkson-black-dress.jpg><p id=ePGqhJjFtG data-wc=49>Kelly opened up about her divorce in October 2020, telling <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a>: "I feel like if you're hiding something, there must be something wrong with it. And there's nothing wrong with anything – life just kind of happens, and it takes turns that you don't expect and are sad."&nbsp;</p><p id=eQ6h3sZcAM9 data-wc=64>The singer also appears to be referencing her failed relationship in her new record, which has been dubbed her "divorce album". Speaking of its title, , Kelly previously explained: "I was trying to find a word, it might be one of the songs on the album [spoiler alert: it is], but I was trying to find a word that really described the whole thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5aa781c77735-gettyimages-161435893.jpg><p id=ecrAoTAD_38 data-wc=33>"I didn't want everybody to think I was just coming out with some 'I'm angry,' 'I'm sad' – just one or two emotions. This album is definitely the arc of an entire relationship."&nbsp;</p><p id=eeL8lj2Ajy data-wc=63>She added: "That whole relationship shouldn't be brought down to one thing. There's the good, the bad, and the ugly kind of thing going on. Chemistry can be a really amazing, sexy, cool, fun thing, but it can also be very bad for you. So that's why I named it Chemistry, I thought it was the perfect title to describe the entire album."&nbsp;</p><h2>Why is Kelly Clarkson leaving LA?&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/389d68b5f39c-kelly-clarkson-and-children.jpg><p id=e-J5eIvos5 data-wc=41>Kelly is relocating to New York City after admitting she needs a "fresh start" for herself and her children. "My family is East Coast. They're North Carolina-based. It was one of those things where I just had to," she told .&nbsp;</p><p id=ee-fp_pY5ph data-wc=48>“Also, there were a lot of personal things going on, too. I feel like our family — me and my kids — really needed a fresh start and I just could not get it here [in Los Angeles]," she continued.
