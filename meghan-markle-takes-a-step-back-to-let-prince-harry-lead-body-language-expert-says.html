The <a href=#>royal</a> couple appeared ‘unified’ in their first public appearance since they were seen at a <a href=#>Bob Marley movie premiere</a> recently. <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> apparently let her 39-year-old husband take the lead, a body language has told us. Let’s dive into what signals the couple were giving off.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-and-harry-have-turned-over-a-new-leaf-body-language-expert-says>Meghan Markle and Harry have ‘turned over a new leaf’, body language expert says</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2016436469-1024x780.jpg><p>The Sussexes enjoyed a three-day trip to Canada for the Invictus Games countdown, and were seen dining with senior officials and hitting the slopes.</p><p>It was during this time, <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> gave a bombshell interview to Good Morning America, where he opened up over <a href=#>King Charles’ cancer diagnosis</a>. He also appeared to give some hope the <a href=#>royal feud between The Firm, Harry and Prince William</a>, may be at an end.</p><p>He told GMA: “I think any illness, any sickness brings families together”.</p><p>The dad-of-two also spoke on how he was grateful he was about to <a href=#>fly over to the UK for 25 hours</a> to see his father and Queen Consort Camilla.</p><p>Before the huge interview, they were seen speaking to people a part of the Invictus Games, and body language expert Darren Stanton gave his two cents on what non-verbal cues they were giving off.</p><p>Stanton, dubbed the ‘Human Lie Detector’, said on behalf of <a href=# rel=nofollow>Betfair Bingo</a>: “For a very long time, the spotlight appeared to be on Meghan, where she was always front and centre at engagements.</p><p>It seems as though the roles have reversed now, as she is very much into supporting Harry. She’s no longer interested in being photographed for the sake of it. Nowadays, she’s fully invested in supporting Harry and focusing on good causes.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-usually-the-duchess-would-be-front-and-center>Usually the duchess would be ‘front and center’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2016440554-710x1024.jpg><p>Stanton continued: “This was definitely reflected in their body language. I think one of the most powerful scenes was when Harry was shaking hands with people and Meghan was behind him.</p><p>“Usually she would be front and center, but as she knows the Invictus Games is his pride and joy, she’s letting him take the lead.</p><p>“That’s one of the most significant, visible signs that she’s only interested in supporting Harry. She wants to take a step back and let Harry take the lead, which is something we call an observant gesture. As a couple, this is Harry’s special project, she’s letting him take centre stage.</p><p>“Now, Meghan seems a lot more relaxed and is throwing herself into the Invictus Games and supporting Harry.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-s-the-start-of-a-new-chapter>It’s the start of a ‘new chapter’</h2><p>After recent news of <a href=#>Harry and Meghan’s new website</a>, experts have been discussing what new path the royals will be taking.</p><p>Stanton believes Meghan Markle and Harry’s body language is also giving off signs they’re opening ‘another chapter’.</p><p>He added: “There were also no signs of tension or nervousness between them, they were very much unified and very much together. It’s like there has been a closing of one chapter and an opening of another. They’ve definitely overcome any past turbulence and turned over a new leaf.”</p><p>The expert continued it seems they’re “lot more of a tighter couple than before”.</p><p>It comes after hurtful rumors last year claimed <a href=#>Meghan Markle’s missing engagement ring</a> was a sign there was trouble in paradise. It didn’t help that a former news editor claimed he saw their <a href=#>marriage lasting years and not decades</a>.</p><p>Although the Sussexes never spoke out about the baseless rumors, a source close to the couple, said it was ‘hurtful’ for Harry.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2d9cLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55krZmbmsBurYysq56oXZeupLeMraZmpJWperG%2ByKeanmWYlr%2BzxYylnJqcXZe8pcWMpZinn6WWtKZ5xLGnnqqkYsCixdJo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bob-morales.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Ritchie's Brother Mechanic Bob Morales?
