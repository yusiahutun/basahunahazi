Hass avocado exports have actually taken the place of major cash crops such as coffee. <a id=https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016/12/15/muranga-avocado-farmers-fetch-more-from-kakuzi-firm_c1473168 href=# title="hass avocado farming, hass avocado seedlings, hass avocado maturity period" rel="nofollow noopener">The government has negotiated with firms such as Kakuzi</a> to buy the fruits from farmers, which has helped in eliminating brokers thus yielding more returns for farmers. Farmers are required to deliver quality fruit and in return Kakuzi buys them at a very good price. Payment is always done seven days after delivery. This is guaranteed payment. The most prominent feature is that it turns dark purple when ripe. Hass avocado offers several benefits which also apply across the family of avocado.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs25f7tnbe4o2g.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rabbit farming in Kenya - rabbit buyers in Kenya</span></p></a><li>They are a significant source of good cholesterol.</li><li>High in protein and mineral content as compared to animal proteins.</li><li>Used in the manufacture of facial and hair oil.</li><li>They boost farmers economically besides earning foreign currency for the exporting country.</li><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: How to manage dairy farm in Kenya</p><h2><strong>What is the difference between a hass avocado and a regular avocado?</strong></h2><p class=align-left>Regular avocados are larger in size and smooth skinned while the hass avocados are smaller and have a pebbly skin that turns dark purple when ripe. However, the biggest difference is the nutritional value in terms of fat content. For instance, two or three slices of a hass avocado contain 4.6 grams of fat and the same portion of a regular avocado contains an estimate of 3 grams of fat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs25f7tnbe4o2g.jpg><h2><strong>How to plant hass avocado tree</strong></h2><p class=align-left>Avocados can be grown from either seedlings or seeds. Through grafting, farmers are able to improve variety by increasing its resistance to diseases and increasing its adaptability to different types of soils. Planting materials should be inspected to ensure that they are free from diseases. Seeds should also be treated with hot water not exceeding 50 degrees Celsius.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs3cp6vuqhepsg.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Large scale rabbit farming in Kenya</span></p></a><h3><strong>Land preparation</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Land preparation should be similar to that of other crops. It is advisable to plant an annual crop before in order to achieve the desired tillage if the land is newly cleared. Also ensure there are windbreakers such as hedges if there are strong winds in the area.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Fish Farming in Kenya Business Plan and Tips</p><h3><strong>Planting holes</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Farmers are advised to plant the trees in a straight line to ease crop husbandry and harvesting. For hass avocados in Kenya, the rectangular pattern of planting is preferred as it eases movement of machinery between the rows. This method also makes it easy for pruning, thinning and inspection.</p><h2><strong>Planting</strong></h2><p class=align-left>Use two buckets of farmyard manure mixed with topsoil, 250gms of double superphosphate fertilizer and a certified insecticide to fill the holes. Ensure that planting is done after the start of rains when the rainwater has penetrated the soil properly. Be careful not to damage the roots when filling up the holes. Irrigation should be done after the first shoot appears and the young plant should be tied to sticks for support.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhsn0g9qipli7g.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All you need to know about carrot farming in Kenya</span></p></a><h2><strong>Pruning</strong></h2><p class=align-left>This starts at the planting stage if the roots are too long and do not fit the planting hole. Trees at an early age are trained in order to maintain a good framework. Pruning is mainly done before the plants begin to flower and upon completion of harvesting. The general rule is that the tree canopy height should be 70% of row width to allow dissemination of light. Pruning is beneficial to the trees as it enables them to yield and provide a superior structure.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Avocado farming to create next millionaires - Raila Odinga</p><h2><strong>Thinning</strong></h2><p class=align-left>It involves removing some of the already formed fruits to reduce competition for nutrients thus producing high-quality fruits.

Anthracnose –it attacks fruits, forming dry, dark brown spots. It is most likely to attack mature fruits. It can be controlled using copper-based fungicides. Chemicals such as Benomyl, Metiram, Propineb, Thiabendazole, Mancozeb or Triforine may also be sprayed to control the disease.</p><p class=align-left>2. Root rot- mostly found in areas with poorly drained soils and areas prone to flood. Preventive measures include use of fungal and hot water treatment of seeds and grafting on resistant rootstalk. The chemicals used to combat this disease are, Ridomil, active ingredient Metalaxyl. It is a granular formulation applied in the soil. The second chemical is known as Alitte and is applied on the leaves.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs3mjbhik3jeng.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Challenges of rabbit farming in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>3. Scab- this disease attacks fruits, leaves and the twigs. Scratches emerge as little dark spots a little raised and are oval or extended. This disease is controlled using the same methods as those of Anthracnose.</p><p class=align-left>4. Cercospora- also known as fruit spot. It leaves small light yellow spots which eventually turn brownish on the leaves and fruits. It is also controlled using similar methods to Anthracnose.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Is onion farming in Kenya worth a shot?</p><h2><strong>Harvesting</strong></h2><p class=align-left>The Kenya hass avocado flowers on October and are ready for picking between June and September. Farmers should identify the correct harvesting period because the avocado fruits are picked raw and ripen off the trees. Farmers should consult avocado experts for better harvesting results. Harvest a few fruits and store them in favorable conditions to ripen. If the fruits ripen evenly, they are considered to have matured.

Proper pest and disease control, plant density and soil fertility are the major factors affecting the yields of hass avocado. Usually, the average yield in Kenya is 87,780 fruits per hectare. There is great potential of hass avocado production especially in Mt. Kenya region and the Rift Valley region because of the favorable climatic condition However there is a great challenge of lack of understanding among some farmers on the pesticide minimal residual levels guidelines by the European market. This poses a great danger because farmers might produce fruits only for them to be rejected by exporting companies.</p><h2><strong>Hass avocado tree spacing</strong></h2><p class=align-left>Spacing depends on factors such as climatic conditions and soil fertility.
