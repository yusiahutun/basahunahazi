A three-year-old boy has died after falling from the ride yesterday<br></p><p>Police said they were ‘inconsolable’.</p><p>The Go Bananas amusement park in Norridge near Chicago, Illinois, has been closed until further notice as detectives and safety teams investigate what happened.</p><p>Investigators will be looking at how the boy managed to get himself free and whether or not he was tall enough to be allowed on the Python Park snake-themed ride.</p><p>The accident happened around 5pm on Saturday night as the popular Chuck E. Cheese style establishment was filled with families enjoying themselves.</p><p>Go Bananas is a popular place for children to have their birthday parties and it is thought there were some celebrating when the accident happened.</p><p>Norridge chief of police James Jobe told MailOnline: ‘Details are still being worked out but it looks like the boy was in the front car with his brother and he managed to get free from the safety bar.</p><p>‘He stood up but fell backward and landed in the join between the first car and the second car.</p><p>‘Then he fell to the floor with serious head injuries. He was declared dead at the scene.’</p><p>Speaking to the Chicago Tribune, a person who answered the door at the Dansby household said his family was not ready to speak publicly about the incident.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/04/03/article-1372913-0B7763E300000578-779_468x286.jpg height=286 width=468 alt="Investigation: The ride is now closed while authorities conduct a full inspection" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Investigation: The ride is now closed while authorities conduct a full inspection</p><p>A neighbour said she often saw Jayson playing with his brother on their family's front lawn and described the boy as a 'very nice, friendly child.'</p><p>Chief Jobe added that the roller coaster, like the rest of the rides in the park, was not an adult-sized roller coaster but a small ride for young children.</p><p>'We have not had any incidents like this before and we have no record of safety issues with the amusement park,’ he said.</p><p>‘It’s a small place with a few rides, amusement arcades and a pizza restaurant.</p><p>‘Saturdays are very popular there so it would have been packed.</p><p>‘It just looks like a tragic accident and a terrible thing to have happened. I’ve spoken with his parents and they are understandably inconsolable.’</p><p>Illinois state safety inspectors are now examining the Python Park ride to see if there were any mechanical problems.</p><p>They will also be interviewing the teenage members of staff who were on duty when the accident happened.</p><p>Go Bananas has been in operation for around six years and caters for children aged between three and 12.</p><p>On its website, it boasts ‘exciting child sized rides, challenging games for all ages and a fantastic 4-story soft playground with tunnels, tubes, slides, chutes and more.’</p><p>The centre claims to offer ‘the ultimate family entertainment experience - combining the excitement of an amusement park and your favourite summer carnival with great tasting pizza and other family favourites!’</p><p>Jim Hayes, the general manager at Go Bananas, told MailOnline that staff were ‘extremely sorrowful’ about what had happened.</p><p>‘We are cooperating with the authorities in their investigation but we have been asked not to talk about it any further,’ he said.</p><p>Asked about the safety record of the Python Pit roller coaster or if they have been any previous accidents, he refused to comment.<br></p><p>A statement the park’s website says: ‘We want to ensure that each of our guests has a safe and enjoyable experience at Go Bananas.’</p><p><br></p><p><a href=#>Go Bananas Birthday</a> from <a href=#>Jerrold Marks</a> on <a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Vimeo</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2BdIORcmhsZ3OdtqStxqhkraeUmbmmvoyDmLKrn6N6ha3NrJmyZZueua2xw2admqScnruoedGoo6Wdopi8or%2FTnqlmoJ%2Bnv6qyyJ6bZp6RoratxY2hq6ak</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./article-40471418-c393-11e9-80cb-43b90921ddfc-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Howard Lavelle Manning | Obituaries">&larr;
