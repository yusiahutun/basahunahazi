Reaching that point of appreciation, though, has not been an easy path.</p><p>In the accompanying interview for the magazine, the actress opened up about her lifelong struggle with body dysmorphia. "I don't ever see myself really the way other people see me," she confessed. "There is never a point in my life where I loved my body. Never, ever."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ab5aee93-798a-4be1-8806-9c665a67b991 data-container-ref=toofab:article:da787b58-c1c5-44a8-af4b-9e414a95a0bd data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/58/5by4/2023/05/15/58ab45115ad347acb3bbf4e73e857a5e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Megan Fox Covers Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, Calls 'Insane' Photos 'Best Pictures I've Ever Taken'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She recalled struggling with this all the way back to childhood. "When I was little that was an obsession I had of like, 'But I should look this way.' And why I had an awareness of my body that young I'm not sure."</p><p>It's particularly unusual for Fox, she explains, because she "grew up in a very religious environment where bodies weren't even like acknowledged."</p><p>Nevertheless, the young Fox was definitely paying attention to hers, even sharing that there were times she would go into the bathroom and "check to see if I had boobs yet."</p><p>"The journey of loving myself is going to be never-ending, I think," Fox shared. The "Jennifer's Body" actress first opened up about her struggles with body dysmorphia in an interview with <a href=#>British GQ</a> in October 2021.</p><p>"We may look at somebody and think, 'That person's so beautiful. Their life must be so easy," she told the outlet then. "They most likely don't feel that way about themselves."</p><p>Even though she spent many years of her life hyper-fixated on her physical appearance, Fox wishes that people would notice something else about her instead. "I have a rainbow aura and it's special," she told SI.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7bdfe4a2-cda5-4834-acde-2f2b79320fec data-container-ref=toofab:article:da787b58-c1c5-44a8-af4b-9e414a95a0bd data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b8/5by4/2022/12/12/b86e604171a04454bccf40e8bd45119f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Megan Fox Hits Back At Criticism After Posting 'Sexual' & 'Naked' AI-Generated Art of Herself</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"What I most want people to know is I'm a genuine soul who is hoping to actually belong to something and not always have to live as a misunderstood outcast," she said. "If they don't respect you, that drains you. And if you're doing that constantly in a cycle, that's going to wear down your self worth and self respect. I want all people, not just women, to have respect for their bodies and themselves."</p><p>Instead, she knows that throughout her career, the public and even the media has been perhaps a bit too focused on her physical appearance, and even seeking out flaws ... or at least fixating on one "flaw" in particular they couldn't seem to let go.</p><p>"I never thought that was a weird thing or an embarrassing thing," Fox said of her thumbs, which became an embarrassingly obsessive talking point for way too many years. "They're just kind of short. Is it really that crazy?"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8fc861c9-5905-4d08-944e-bf9c3fcb863a data-container-ref=toofab:article:da787b58-c1c5-44a8-af4b-9e414a95a0bd data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/18/5by4/2021/09/13/18878cb0214f4c179e6864d611347adc_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Megan Fox Reveals Body Dysmorphia: 'I Have A Lot Of Deep Insecurities'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She explained that they're actually referred to as "murderer's thumbs," because apparently the distance between the tip and first joint of the thumb is supposed to be indicative of one's temper. That would suggest Fox has a short one, but she says that's far from the case.</p><p>"It takes a lot to get me to lose my temper, I mean a lot. I have crazy patience," she said. "But when you do push me over the edge, you're on demon time and you better run for your life and it's scary as f---!"</p><p>As for the thumbs themselves, while that seems to be the thing that's been fixated on all these years, Fox herself said that she has "tons of other flaws" that she thinks are even "more interesting," though she wisely did not offer any of them up.</p><p>While there has been plenty of attention that she hasn't appreciated over the years, Fox did share what kind of attention she does enjoy. It came up while discussing the idea of what kind of legacy she wants to leave behind.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ba7d66a2-79a7-4553-89da-0f204e5cb0e3 data-container-ref=toofab:article:da787b58-c1c5-44a8-af4b-9e414a95a0bd data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/61/5by4/2022/04/27/610acd5e797d4733b44149b5b4c47c45_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Megan Fox on Supporting Son Wearing Dresses: 'I Just Wish That Humanity Was Not Like This'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>As it turns out, Fox is one of those people who isn't all that concerned about legacy because, as she put it, "When I'm dead what timeline am I gonna be in and will it matter? It won't matter."</p><p>Instead, she's more concerned with the impact she's having now while she's still here. And that's where she opened up about what kind of interactions are the most meaningful to her, the closest thing to a legacy -- such as it is -- that she would be happy about.</p><p>"I can't tell you how many girls specifically come up to me and say, 'You were the reason I realized I was gay.' Or, 'I realized I was bisexual.' Or, 'You gave me the courage to tell my parents that I was gay,'" she shared. "And that's so much more gratifying than somebody coming up to me and being like, 'I love your movies' or 'You're so talented.'"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:03fbdb46-a36a-49da-80bb-56621dbef600 data-container-ref=toofab:article:da787b58-c1c5-44a8-af4b-9e414a95a0bd data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a7/5by4/2022/07/28/a755fbecea904862a338c3a6665f9982_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty/Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Megan Fox Got to Meet Ex-Husband Brian Austin Green's New Baby with Sharna Burgess</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Having somebody tell me that I somehow had a part in giving them the courage to realize who they are is the best compliment I can imagine," she said.</p><p>During the shoot itself, Fox said that it took her a while to get into a good "groove" with the photographer, Greg Swales, as she felt "a lot of pressure" heading into it and even her own vision of what she was hoping to achieve.
