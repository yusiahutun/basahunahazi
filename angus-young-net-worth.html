He is widely recognized as the co-founder, songwriter, only constant original member, and lead guitarist of the famous Australian hard rock band AC/DC. In his musical career, he has added immense fame and fortune to his name.</p><p>According to&nbsp;The Richest, Angus Young’s net worth is estimated to be $140 million. For now, let’s learn how Angus amassed such immense fortune in his name and his earning details.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Angus_Young_Net_Worth_And_Earnings></span>Angus Young Net Worth And Earnings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Angus Young’s fortune is estimated to be $140 million. The massive wealth that he has earned comprises his income from music albums sales and other ventures. His first guitar was a cheap acoustic model that his mom had purchased second-hand.</p><p>Similarly, his first Gibson SG was bought around 1970, which was also a second-hand, and he bought it from a music shop just down the street from his house. He began his musical career in the band Marcus Hook Roll Band, which <strong>George Young</strong> and <strong>Harry Vanda</strong>&nbsp;formed. <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Malcolm Young</strong></a> was also in the band.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Income_From_Musical_Career></span>Income From Musical Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As stated earlier, Angus began his musical career in the band Marcus Hook Roll Band, which consists of musicians like George, Malcolm, and Harry. He also played in a local band called Kantuckee. Then, in 1973, he and his brother, Malcolm, formed AC/DC.</p><p>He was on lead guitar, Malcolm on rhythm guitar, <strong>Dave Evans</strong> on vocals, <strong>Colin Burgess</strong> on drums, and<strong> Larry Van Kriedt</strong> on bass guitar. Then, they began releasing several of their music albums which were sold in millions of copies. Furthermore, the album “High Voltage” earned 3X Platinum Records in the USA, and its minimum earnings were $3,000,000.</p><p>Similarly, High Voltage earned 5X Platinum Records in Australia, and its minimum earnings there were $350,000. Apart from this album, Angus has released several other albums from the band, which helped him gain immense wealth. Their other album, Power Up, became the fastest-selling album of 2020 in the UK, the USA, and Australia, by selling a total of 117,000 copies in its first week in the USA.</p><p>Furthermore, here are some of AC/DC’s albums and their sales as given by The Richest.</p><table id=detail_table><tr><th>Albums</th><th>Record Sales</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>The Razors Edge</td><td>$8,570,000</td></tr><tr><td>Blow Up Your Video</td><td>$1,910,000</td></tr><tr><td>Let There Be Rock</td><td>$3,640,000</td></tr><tr><td>Fly on the Wall</td><td>$1,790,000</td></tr><tr><td>Highway to Hell</td><td>$11,060,000</td></tr><tr><td>Back in Black</td><td>$35,540,000</td></tr><tr><td>For Those About To Rock We Salute You</td><td>$7,290,000</td></tr><tr><td>Flick of the Switch</td><td>$1,570,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Apart from these records, the band has also released several music videos which helped the bandmate earn a huge income. In addition, they also earned from the ticket sales of their concert at various places.</p><p>This is one of the many examples of the music albums that Angus has released with the band. As a result, he must have earned generously throughout his music career.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Andrew Reynolds Earnings And Net Worth</a></strong></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Income_From_Other_Ventures></span>Income From Other Ventures<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The fame and popularity that Angus has gained in his musical career must have benefitted him with several endorsement and sponsorship offers. In addition, these sponsorship offers must-have benefitted Angus in increasing his net worth significantly.</p><p>Similarly, according to&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">MusicRadar</a>,&nbsp;in October 2020, an AC/DC fan paid $28,000 just to have a guitar lesson from Young. Well, this shows the huge fanbase that he has created around the world.</p><p>Thus, with more than two decades of a musical journey and more than dozens of albums from the AC/DC band, Angus Young’s net worth of $140 million seems reasonable. Moreover, he is still ongoing on his musical career, so his fortune might increase in the future as well.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lifestyle_And_Assets></span>Lifestyle And Assets<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As stated earlier, Angus Young’s fortune is estimated to be $140 million. Well, with a net worth like that, it won’t be a surprise if he lives a privileged and luxurious lifestyle. Similarly, he might also pay a generous amount in taxes. He<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> lives a</a> comfortable life with his wife<strong> <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Ellen Young</a></strong> in the Kangaroo Point area of Sydney.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Angus-Young-with-his-wife.jpg><p>Similarly, in 2007, Angus and his wife designed a 3-story mansion in Aalten, Netherlands. It is also his wife’s hometown. Angus had spent millions of dollars on the mansion. In addition, he also owns a home in the UK.</p><p>Since his brother, Malcolm’s house is estimated to be worth $30 million, Angus’s house must also cost a similar amount.</p><p>Furthermore, Angus must have a good collection of fancy cars as he has such a huge fortune to his name. And he must have a good insurance policy for those cars.</p><p>Nonetheless, Angus Young must be doing great for himself.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Trivia_And_Facts></span>Trivia And Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Angus was born on the 31st of March, 1955, to his mother, <strong>Margaret Young</strong>, and his father, <strong>William Young</strong>.</li><li>His parents have eight children and he is the youngest.</li><li>Young was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003 as a member of the band AC/DC.</li></ul><p>For more updates on&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Entertainment</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Celebrity Babies</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>YouTubers</strong></i></a>, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Movies & T.V.
