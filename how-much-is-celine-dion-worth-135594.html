As fans may recall, her No. 1 song “Because You Loved Me” served as the signature tune for Up Close & Personal, starring <strong><a href=#>Michelle Pfeiffer</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Robert Redford</a></strong>.</p><p>“Because You Loved Me” earned Celine two Grammys, along with nominations for both a Golden Globe and an Academy Award. And that all happened before she blessed the world with yet another incredible movie-inspired classic — 1997’s “<a href=#>My Heart Will Go On</a>,” the song that has become synonymous with <strong>James Cameron</strong>’s Titanic.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the epic track won Celine two more Grammys — and she finally nabbed the Golden Globe she was robbed of before. Since then, the mom-of-three — she shares <a href=#>son René-Charles and twin sons Eddy and Nelson</a> with her late husband — has racked up a total of five Grammys.</p><h2>Celine Dion Had 2 Las Vegas Residencies</h2><p>In 2003, the Canadian superstar <a href=#>kicked off her Las Vegas residency</a>, A New Day…, which ran for nearly five years at Caesars Palace. According to Billboard, her more than 700-performance show remains the highest grossing residency of all time, bringing in a reported $385 million.</p><p>Celine returned to the Nevada desert four years later for a second residency which ran from 2011 to 2019. The 427 performances earned her a whopping $296.2 million, <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> reported at the time.</p><p><span>Aside from wowing crowds night after night with her show-stopping concert on the Strip, Celine has released 26 studio albums — which have gone on to sell more than 220 million copies worldwide.</span></p><p>According to the “I’m Alive” songstress, she has her fans to thank for all her success.</p><p>“I don’t want to sound pretentious,” <a href=#>she told ET in 2016</a>, “but I think beyond the music, I think I do have a relationship with my fans that are [pushing] me [along], saying, ‘You know what, Celine?’ They’ve been such supporters in my good days and my bad days.”</p><h2>Why Did Celine Dion Cancel Her 2023 ‘Courage’ World Tour?</h2>Celine shocked fans in May 2023 when she canceled the remaining portion of her “Courage” world tour. In a statement she shared via <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter</a>, her team explained that she was “unable to successfully prepare for and perform the remainder of the tour.” The music artist had recently been diagnosed with Stiff Person Syndrome.<p>“As the world has emerged from the pandemic, Celine has continued to be treated for a diagnosed medical condition that prevents her from performing,” her team’s statement read. “Celine is working hard on her recovery. … We do have every hope that someday soon, Celine will be able to come to all of these cities in Europe to perform for her amazing fans, but that time is simply not now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46hprBlnaqwqXnIrGScnZyeu6Z5w6Kmp2WnpL%2B1tIxqam5taWl8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./windows-microsoft-edge-opens-automatically.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Microsoft Edge Keep Opening Itself on Windows?
