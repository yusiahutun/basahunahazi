Things You Should Know</a></b></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Arnold Byrd Is A Former Seargent In The US Marine: More On His Profession</strong></h2><p>After completing his Master’s degree in 1998, Arnold started his professional career as a construction site project manager in California, where he worked for just over two years. In April 2001, he took on a role as Technical Director at GE Transportation and stayed there for just under two years.</p><p>After his time at GE Transportation, Arnold joined the United States Naval Reserve as a Future Operations Manager in 2003 and worked there for a little over two years. He then took on a role as a maintenance and repair officer for APL, one of the world’s leading ocean carriers. Additionally, he worked as a marine officer for Eagle Marine Services.</p><p>Arnold currently holds the position of Operations Manager at Fenix Marine Service, a position he has held since 2018. He also has been serving as a Container Yard Supervisor in Terminal Island, California for more than three years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Arnold Is Married To An Actress-Wife Jenifer Lewis</strong></h2><p>Arnold Byrd and Jennifer Lewis were married in 2012 after dating for a few years. Not much is known about how they first met, but it is clear that they have been deeply in love since the beginning of their relationship. The couple has been happily married for over a decade and continue to live together.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis has expressed her happiness in being married to Arnold Byrd. In an interview with News4usonline, she stated that she feels great as his spouse.</p><p>“I am so in love and so happy, “He’s tall, dark and handsome. He’s intelligent. He’s the father of three children. So he has lived. He has a life and he doesn’t have to borrow mine. I found myself a grown man-a grown man who was looking for an adult relationship. I am one of the most fortunate women in the world.”</p><p>It appears that Arnold and Jennifer have a strong and fulfilling relationship and enjoy spending time together as a married couple.</p><p><strong>Short Bio On His Wife, Jennifer Lewis</strong></p><p>Jennifer Lewis was born on January 25, 1957 in Missouri, USA and was the youngest child in her family. From a young age, she dreamed of becoming an artist and eventually moved to New York to pursue this dream. In 1979, she made her debut as a singer in Broadway musicals. However, over time, she shifted her focus to acting and established a career in this field.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis made her film debut in 1988’s The Beach and has since appeared in a number of films and TV series such as Sister Act, What’s Love Got to Do With It, Dirty Laundry, and Murphy Brown, among others. She has gained the reputation of being the “Mother of Black Hollywood” due to her roles as a matriarch in various films.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Arnold Byrd’s Spouse Jennifer Struggled Sex-Addiction And Bipolar Disorder</strong></h2><p>In her memoir, The Mother of Black Hollywood, Jennifer Lewis shared her personal journey and revealed that she struggled with undiagnosed mental health issues in her twenties. She described how she turned to sex and alcohol as coping mechanisms to manage her mental health challenges.</p><p>In discussing her experience with mental illness, the actress wrote:</p><p>Just as alcoholism isn’t really about the liquor, my addiction wasn’t really about the sex. It was about the unresolved psychological problems that caused me pain. Sex was simply my painkiller’.</p><p>As her condition worsened, Jennifer Lewis sought help from a therapist who diagnosed her with bipolar disorder and helped her deal with her addiction to sex. She began taking medication, which she initially resisted because she believed it would make her feel like a “zombie.”</p><p>Eventually, Jennifer Lewis decided to follow her therapist Rachel’s advice and began to see improvement in her condition. She stated:</p><p>My responses were no longer as extreme. No matter what big issue or catastrophe loomed, I could say, “bring it” and move forward. I was better able to listen and be present and aware of the world around me,’</p><p>Jennifer Lewis has overcome her own struggles with mental illness and is now in a good place emotionally. Her experience has made her more understanding and empathetic towards others with mental health challenges, and she actively helps people with bipolar disorder and is open to addressing mental health issues.</p><p><strong>Arnold Byrds’ Children: He Has An Adoptive Daughter With His Wife</strong></p><p>Arnold and Jennifer do not have any biological children. However, they did adopt a daughter named Charmaine Lewis. When they adopted her, Charmaine was seven years old and Jennifer had met her through the Los Angeles Big Brothers/Big Sisters program.</p><p>Today, Charmaine is also an actress and has appeared in the films Strange Blood and Instagram is a Liar, both released in 2015.</p><p><strong>His 3 Children Before His Relationship With Jennifer</strong></p><p>It appears that Baird has two sons and a daughter from a previous relationship.
