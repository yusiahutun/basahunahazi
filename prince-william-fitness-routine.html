The time between beeps then gets shorter for each new level of the test. <strong>Prince William would have needed to get to a level of 9.1 on the 20 metre test in order to pass the fitness test.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e5Y8wqwBnr data-wc=51>Training to pass any military induction fitness test requires mental stamina and exceptional physical fitness - so much so that the RAF even provides a 12-week training programme for any beginners considering applying. Though it does recommend training for "as long as possible" in order to improve any chances of passing.&nbsp;</p><h2>Prince William's 5BX training plan&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f828bb7e6f55-prince-william.jpg><p id=ebeZTh4PRf data-wc=36>Prince William may no longer have an active role in the RAF, but he is said to have kept up a military-style exercise routine, which was also loved by the late Prince Phillip and King Charles.</p><p id=eI0_2IxAt3 data-wc=27>The exercises – based on the Royal Canadian Air Force exercise plan – are said to have been passed down through several generations of the royal family.</p><p id=e9xSXlOXAaK-Q data-wc=12>The 11-minute workout is designed to target all parts of the body.</p><p id=e0yaAJ798w data-wc=37>It involves two minutes of stretches, one minute of sit-ups, one minute of back and leg raises, one minute of push-ups and six minutes of running on the spot, while doing 10 eagle jumps every 75 steps.</p><h2>Prince William's running</h2><p id=enuA9DSVO1 data-wc=26>Much like his wife, Kate, the father-of-three is understood to be a keen runner, which is likely a hobby he picked up during his military training.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Prince William takes on a relay race with Princess Kate and Prince Harry</figure><p id=ephMZ6PMUT data-wc=46>When the royal appeared onstage at the Earthshot Prize Innovation Summit at the Plaza Hotel in September 2023, he struck up a conversation with former prize winner, Vaitea Cowan, who asked: "I heard - is it true?

The royal, who shares his love of equestrianism with much of his family, has played polo since a young age.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f06ef8965fae-prince-of-wales-polo.jpg><p id=eo96ObDTe1 data-wc=31>William's hobby is one he and his brother Prince Harry shared as teens, with Harry playing at a professional level in the US, where he now lives with wife Meghan Markle.</p><p id=eZTZwsOP6W data-wc=23>The Prince of Wales is obviously skilled at the sport too, which may come as a surprise, as he has a polo handicap.</p><p id=eNvuUUXU2t data-wc=34>Any seasoned polo fans will know that the sport is played using the right hand, so given that Prince William is left-handed, he's at a slight disadvantage when it comes to playing the sport.</p><h2>Prince William's swimming</h2><p id=erahIs9I_3 data-wc=43>The Prince of Wales is a keen aquaphile, having learned how to swim in Buckingham Palace's secret swimming pool from a young age. As a teenager, the Prince was a dedicated water poloist, even playing the sport competitively when he reached his twenties.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fce0024f3358-prince-william-water-polo.jpg><p id=eh607Tf61N data-wc=53>William's love for water was revealed in 2007 when he was appointed patron of the English Schools' Swimming Association. "Having swum and played water polo throughout my days at school and university, I am well aware of the great benefits and pleasure that can be derived from them," he said at the time.</p><p id=eZY6cBV7EO data-wc=45>While water polo isn't a commonly played sport in the UK, we can see why Princess Kate's husband likes it. It's fantastic for building endurance, as players are not allowed to touch the bottom of the pool and have to tread water the whole time.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
