Popular haunts include Rollie, a Venice Beach skater park-inspired sushi joint specialising in Instagrammable open-faced hand rolls, and Carbs, which offers deep-dish-style square pizza that Fang fondly remembers from his formative years in New York. Then there’s Carbon, an 8,000 sq ft space that is part restaurant, part venue and part nightclub.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/bfadc442-b269-43e0-b4ca-3973e6b8bba4_c7182f07.jpg>It’s an impressive achievement, especially for someone who has spent most of his career in the fashion industry. “Fashion and food don’t usually go together, but I take a lot of inspiration from fashion and streetwear, especially brands that that have changed the shape of retail <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">like Supreme</span></a>,” he says. “They’ve been able to create demand and continue collaborating with brands unrelated to fashion or streetwear, which for me is so inspiring. They have proven that this model works and I hope I can bring some of that to the world of F&B and cookies.”<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Hong Kong’s 10 richest billionaires of 2023, revealed</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Wil Fang’s humble origins</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/f3de2cfe-55e2-40ad-94be-88ab15f55c78_9ca1e446.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ironically, Fang decided from a very young age that a career in F&B was not for him. He spent most of his youth in New Hampshire where he waited on tables and worked behind the scenes at his parents’ businesses, which included a chain of Chinese restaurants and American-style Japanese steakhouses.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At university he studied engineering and business management, but when an opportunity to apply for an internship at Ralph Lauren in New York presented itself, he jumped at the chance. Although he didn’t get in initially, Fang – who had been crowned “Most Fashionable” at high school – managed to snag a place after another intern dropped out at the last minute.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After graduation he joined the iconic American brand full time, working in the newly set-up global business development department for over 10 years until Apple came calling. His first foray as an entrepreneur came in 2016 when he returned to his native Taiwan to open DPT, a multi-brand lifestyle shop selling edgy fashion brands like Maison Kitsuné and Thom Browne. It also boasted a cool cafe which sold coffee and, you guessed it, cookies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/e8bd2d60-4ce3-4638-bd32-a36be509f1b4_560b8e37.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Taiwan has great coffee but we couldn’t figure out what to do with the food. I am a kid from a small American town where you don’t eat cake just on birthdays, you eat it on Thursdays,” says Fang. “Cookies are the ultimate comfort food so we put a chocolate chip cookie on the menu. It was a recipe I had been playing with at home for 10 years at that point and I had no idea it was going to do well.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How Grace Chan went from Miss Hong Kong to proud mama – exclusive interview</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The grand Hong Kong debut</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/690d9ee0-d757-4801-92b9-ef74e8b53ec9_6bab06af.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the fashion business folded after a year and a half, Fang was able to salvage the cafe and the cookies, which were becoming increasingly popular. Soon he was hauling them back to friends in Hong Kong, which inspired him to launch a separate concept in the city in 2018.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There was no vision, I’m not going to lie. But I knew I wanted to brand the cookies so that someone in fashion would want to buy them and it wouldn’t feel weird. I wanted people to feel that they were buying something luxury without being bougie, so our packaging was very clean and minimal. Not everybody loves our cookie – it’s quite dense and big – but that didn’t matter. People don’t necessarily buy it cause it’s the best – I wanted them to buy into the brand,” he says.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">Fashion and food don’t usually go together, but I take a lot of inspiration from fashion and streetwearWil Fang</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Naturally Fang’s background in fashion marketing played a pivotal role in transforming Cookie DPT into more than just another home-grown baking business. At the time, there was a space in the market that was ripe for reinvention – the only other competitors back then were Mrs Field’s Cookies and Homie Cookies – so he started out online, selling via Instagram alongside occasional pop-ups at food festivals around town.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A turning point came when he was offered a space to open a pop-up at The Landmark mall in Hong Kong (he was introduced to the powers-that-be by his fashion friends at Hypebeast), where they sold out in an hour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/5d0c4552-c24e-4401-ae38-b0d88dd27469_039f0bbd.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite Covid-19, business continued to flourish, although he was met with a different challenge in the form of fresh competition eager to cash in on the cookie craze that had taken over the city. This inspired Fang to follow in footsteps of Supreme and other streetwear labels, and Cookie DPT began to do weekly drops of limited-edition flavours alongside cool collaborations with other popular food outlets and streetwear platforms such as Sneaker Surge.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is Young Mazino, the breakout star in hit Netflix series Beef?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When there’s competition you take it in your stride, try to focus and stay the course. It’s frustrating but also flattering. Cookie DPT showed tremendous growth during Covid but we had to see if we could push the envelope and continue riding the momentum without stagnating the brand. We continued pushing weekly flavours, doing quarterly collaborations and even opened a flagship. We were all in,” says Fang.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">A passion for lifestyle brands</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/1ac1f748-0b55-4b72-9c8a-d235c0b97662_0bf8eb81.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Cookie DPT is his main baby, Fang has thrown his energy into other projects. The latest, Renation, is a lifestyle fitness studio offering a 360 degree wellness experience that includes a space to spin or train, a juice bar to recharge, and services ranging from stretching and physiotherapy to sports massages all under one roof.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The connecting thread between everything I do is that each was born out of a personal need or something that I enjoy in my daily life. I am not trying to build an empire like Black Sheep or Maximal. All my businesses are based around foods I craved or food from places I’d visit when I travel. We open things that mean a lot to me or my team,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/4c248f4e-d2d2-40b4-b679-810c2de45fc9_cae35757.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fang is optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. In April, the brand celebrated its fifth anniversary and also announced a collaboration with Shake Shack, although he says the next months will be critical in deciding which of his brands will thrive. He also hopes to rekindle his passion for fashion – he was a consultant before opening DPT – although he says his focus will be on his F&B businesses.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Bernice Liu’s journey from TVB queen to wine maven – exclusive interview</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Fashion has to be something you live and breathe, and at least for the interim, I need to work at what we’ve already established,” he says. “My goal is to continue bridging the gap between fashion and everything else in the world. I don’t want people to think we are just a cookie brand. I want to make sure all my brands continue to push the envelope a little. I hope our customers can appreciate that we are bringing concepts to Hong Kong that they haven’t seen or in a way no one else is doing. That to me is success.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpydnJqvs7XTsmaaqqSesK2xjmxpanFhZn9wr86ooqKdo2Kzor%2FHoqanZZmjwKqwxGafqKaXYriwusZmmZqrlZl6uLXLZp2appeoerGt0qygqKZdobansdKtsKWdXay8s7fIp55mqpGhval5y5qsq52eYq6vsIyap6mklQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-rich-is-lindsay-shookus-net-worth-salary-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Rich Is Lindsay Shookus?
