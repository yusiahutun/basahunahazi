That project also failed to take off.</p><p>Also in 2006 he had a boxing match with Jack Osbourne for Sport Relief.</p><p>A couple of years later, he formed S Club 3 with Jo O’Meara and Paul Cattermole, performing in universities and nightclubs.</p><p>He again dabbled with a solo career, this time as rapper City Boy, but didn't see much success.</p><p>S Club 7 got back together in 2015 for a one-off reunion tour, before Bradley, Jo and this time Tina carried on as S Club 3.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27006337.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_EHP_CHP_190522MADONNA_67927JPG.jpg><p>Bradley, 40, has also topped up his earnings along the way by writing songs for JLS and Sugababe Mutya Buena.</p><p>But he's also suffered heartbreak, after his cousin, Andre Bent, 21, was stabbed to death outside of a nightclub in 2019.</p><p>His best friend Kayode Badejo, 20, was also jailed for a non-fatal stabbing attack in the same fight.</p><p>Bradley said on the night of his cousin’s death: "I'd rather be here performing for you Worcester, than moping at home.
