Kennedy Jr. and model and actress Daryl Hannah crossed paths again in 1988 at a family wedding.&nbsp;Soon after, they began dating. Apart from looking good together — Kennedy earned the title of&nbsp;People's Sexiest Man Alive in 1988 (despite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>his&nbsp;"sloppy" style</a>), while Hannah made Empire magazine's list of "100 Sexiest Stars in Film History" in 1995 — these two jibed well.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For someone as famous and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>publicly hounded</a>&nbsp;as Kennedy, it was probably comforting to be with a fellow celebrity who wasn't blindsided by the demands of the press and also understood that you sometimes need to stage a rollerblading date for the sake of appearances (more on that, below). However, their relationship was far from perfect, especially in the eyes of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>"helicopter mom" Jackie Kennedy</a>. As a result, the pair called it quits in 1994 after being romantically linked for over five years.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's a look back at John F.

Gillon's biography&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>America's Reluctant Prince: The Life of John F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, Kennedy and Hannah first met in the early '80s while on respective family vacations in Saint Martin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"John found it odd that Daryl seemed to carry a teddy bear with her wherever she went, but also found her fascinating," Gillon wrote of their initial meeting.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They were introduced by Hannah's billionaire stepfather Jerrold Wexler, who'd made large contributions to the presidential campaign of Ted Kennedy. However, it wasn't until a few years later that the two started dating.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-october-1992-daryl-hannah-and-jfk-jr-are-first-spotted-together></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>October 1992: Daryl Hannah and JFK Jr. are first spotted together</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hannah and Kennedy met again at the wedding of his aunt,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lee Radziwill</a>, to director Herb Ross in 1988. At the time, both parties were in relationships with other people — Hannah had spent the last 10 years with singer-songwriter Jackson Browne, while Kennedy had been dating actress&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Christina Haag</a>&nbsp;since 1985. Shortly after, they began seeing each other.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The&nbsp;Wall Street&nbsp;actress and Kennedy remained non-exclusive until 1992 when the latter flew to Los Angeles after Hannah had a domestic incident with Browne at the time,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>reported&nbsp;People</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-1993-daryl-hannah-denies-she-and-jfk-jr-are-getting-married></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>1993: Daryl Hannah denies she and JFK Jr. are getting married</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although the couple never wed, that didn't keep the marriage rumors from circulating.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's getting really annoying. I get asked about it all the time," Hannah told&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly&nbsp;in 1993,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>per&nbsp;People</a>, about speculation that she and Kennedy were going to tie the knot. "This morning, I call up my plumber, and even he asks me. Oh, brother, I'm just trying to get my pipes fixed. Why can't people talk about something else?"<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-august-1994-daryl-hannah-and-jfk-jr-break-up></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>August 1994: Daryl Hannah and JFK Jr. break up</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Stephen Rose/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gillon, a historian and friend of Kennedy's, told&nbsp;InStyle&nbsp;exclusively that he thought "John just found Daryl so self-absorbed."&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In&nbsp;America's Reluctant Prince, he wrote that while Kennedy's mom, Jackie, was in the hospital in New York just days before she died in 1994, Kennedy was in L.A. for the funeral of Hannah's dog.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fueling the story's absurdity, Hannah got angry with Kennedy because he hadn't chosen a more elaborate box for the dog's ashes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That just infuriated him," Gillon said. "And even after [Jackie] died, Daryl had another dog that was sick, and John was up in Martha's Vineyard or Hyannis Port, and Daryl's on the phone talking about her dog all the time, and John is there in the kitchen with [his longtime friend] Sasha Chermayeff, and he says, 'Can you believe this. I just lost my mom, and all she wants to talk about is her sick dog.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though "in his mind, the relationship had already ended," Kennedy knew he couldn't let a public breakup take away from his mother's passing, so he did what any grieving child who was protective of their parent would do: stage a rollerblading outing with Hannah to distract the media and quell any rumors about a split.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">No doubt, adding to the mounting tension between them through the years, the former First Lady had not been a fan of Hannah. According to Christopher Andersen, who wrote&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Good Son: JFK Jr. and the Mother He Loved</a>, while his mom never directly confronted him about Hannah, whenever the actress came over to her apartment for dinner, she would manage to eat on a tray in another room.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>NEW YORK DAILY NEWS ARCHIVE/GETTY IMAGES</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the book&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Kennedy Heirs</a>, author J. Randy Taraborrelli wrote that Jackie had never fully given her son her blessing regarding Hannah as his girlfriend.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"John had measured most of the women in his life by Jackie's opinion of them," wrote Taraborrelli. "If his mother approved, John would decide he wasn't sure. However, if his mother disapproved, as she did with actress Daryl Hannah, John became even more attached." Nevertheless, by August 1994, about three months after his mom's death, Kennedy and Hannah had broken up for good,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>according to United Press Internal (UPI)</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following the split, Hannah took a break from getting involved in high-profile relationships. By 2001, however, she was romantically linked with actor&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Val Kilmer</a>, though it didn't last. In 2018,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>People&nbsp;reported</a>&nbsp;the&nbsp;Splash&nbsp;star married musician Neil Young, who she had been dating since 2014.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kennedy went on to date and later married Calvin Klein publicist&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Carolyn Bessette</a>&nbsp;in 1996. Kennedy, Bessette, and her sister Lauren, died on July 16, 1999, in a plane crash off Martha's Vineyard that Kennedy piloted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGekl8Futs6hpWaeXaCyr7rEnbBmoqJisaK%2B2KVkoZmeo66p</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./queen-elizabeths-secret-handbag-signals-subtle-gestures.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Queen Elizabeths secret handbag signals: the subtle gestures that reveal when the British royal n">&larr;
