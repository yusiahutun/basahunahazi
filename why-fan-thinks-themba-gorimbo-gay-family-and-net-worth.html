You may read about his family history and financial worth in this post.</strong></p><p>Zimbabwean-born Mixed Martial Artist (MMA) Themba Gorimbo goes as Themba T. Lawrence Gorimbo.</p><p>He trains at MMA Masters and competes for the Ultimate Fighting Championship in the welterweight class.</p><p>In addition, Themba experienced extreme adversity throughout his life, which made him fight to survive.</p><p>In the South African Extreme Fighting tournament, he emerged victorious in the welterweight division.</p><p>Gorimbo’s success is also a result of the enormous amount of effort and commitment he makes each day.</p><p>During his difficulties, Dwayne Johnson, popularly known as “The Rock,” gave him vital support.</p><p>Themba began his career in the mixed martial arts field in 2010, although he didn’t make his UFC debut until February 2023.</p><h2><span id=Why_does_Fan_believe_that_Themba_is_gay>Why does Fan believe that Themba is gay?</span></h2><p>Because Themba Gorimbo Gay is often seen with males and has not disclosed his relationship status, fans are considering Themba Gorimbo Gay.</p><p>After learning about his difficult trip, Dwayne Johnson was moved by his tale and gave him a stunning mansion as a surprise.</p><p>They thus became close friends and were often seen together. There are other photos of them together as well.</p><p>As a result, people conjectured that Themba Gorimbo is a homosexual guy who enjoys spending out with men. He is heterosexual rather than homosexual, however.</p><p>It’s thought that Themba is married. He hasn’t, however, disclosed any information about his marriage to the public.</p><h2><span id=Family_Themba_Gorimbo>Family Themba Gorimbo</span></h2><p>Themba Gorimbo, who was 32 years old as of late, was born in Bikita, Masvingo, Zimbabwe, on January 23, 1991.</p><p>Although details about his parents are lacking, it is known that his father died four years after his mother, who died when he was nine.</p><p>After his parents passed away, he and his brothers were left as orphans. He also had to accept responsibility for his brothers and himself.</p><p>For the sake of his surviving family, he allegedly mined the fields for Marange diamonds illegally, according to Zimbabwe Profiles.</p><p>German shepherds viciously assaulted him when he was apprehended by the police one night, leaving him covered in cuts.</p><p>In addition, he made the decision to start again after just about leaving the circumstances.</p><p>He is said to have siblings, although the precise number is not stated. Therefore, the number of his siblings is still unclear.</p><p>Many of his followers have raised money for him in response to his financial situation. Because he had little money, they even assisted him in accepting a fighting ticket.</p><p>His financial circumstances were merciful, yet he never took a break from his hard labor. In addition, his commitment to bettering himself increased his concentration on his training.</p><p>The boxer demonstrated this by winning his bouts and putting in more effort for his next ones.</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth_of_Themba_Gorimbo>Net Worth of Themba Gorimbo</span></h2><p>In his life and professional MMA career, Themba Gorimbo has achieved a great deal. He became one of the world’s greatest fighters after overcoming tragedy, brutality, and poverty.</p><p>His accomplishments and life narrative have inspired many people in Zimbabwe and beyond Africa.</p><p>After learning that he had just $7 in his account before his most recent travel, Dwayne recently surprised him by purchasing a new house for him in Miami.</p><p>Themba’s riches have also been greatly influenced by his mixed martial arts career. He receives compensation from sponsorships, endorsements, fight rewards, bonuses, and other sources.</p><p>In addition, his estimated net worth is around $500,000.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
