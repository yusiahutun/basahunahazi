They will break the seriousness and anxiety witnessed during the period.</p><ul><li>Can you imagine life without school and exams? I wish it could start now. Wishing you success.</li><li>Exams are like ex-boyfriends and ex-girlfriends. They harass you until late at night, cut you off from the world, and yet all one can do is quickly get over them. Good luck.</li><li>A girl may not help you to get a lot of marks, but marks help you to get a lot of girls. So love your studies, not girls.</li><li>Hundreds of years have passed, and millions of tomorrows have come, but still, hope is alive in all students “Tomorrow I will definitely start studying.” Darling, start today lest you ruin your future.</li><li>The law says “If you can’t convince them then at least confuse them”. Do you know which law it is? This is the law of answering in examination.</li><li>One of the best captions written on a clock in an exam hall…“TIME WILL PASS. WILL YOU?”</li><li>A thermometer is not the only thing that gets a degree without having a brain! A silent message for all students... I wish you nothing but success.</li><li>Studying is all about eating lessons without having worry of digesting it. Because one day you have to puke all those things what you have been storing for all though the year. All the best for your exam.</li><li>Exam offer!!! Bring a chiton exam day, scratch and show it to your nearest professor, win a free trip to principal’s office, and enjoy three years vacation at home. Don't be stupid, work hard for genuine success.</li><li>For those students, who think too many degrees make them hot, it is the time to be cool as exam is approaching with the eyes full of tears. So, study hard and don’t lose focus in your life. All the very best.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/221ab161495df6bb.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Unique bio for Instagram for girls to show attitude, class, and style</span></p></a><h2 id=261634-prayerful-wishes-for-exam-success-for-students class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Prayerful wishes for exam success for students</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d5cbf5edec1ee9a0.png><p class=align-left>Prayer for success in exams is important.
