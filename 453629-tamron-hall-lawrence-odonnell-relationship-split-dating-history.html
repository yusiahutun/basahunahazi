People have never been sure that the two were in a relationship as they never came out to confirm nor deny the dating rumours. After rumours of dating for years, stories about an upcoming marriage also came up.</p><p class=align-left>Many <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sources claim</a> that Tamron and Lawrence <a href=#>started dating</a> in 2011. Their relationship story started after Lawrence separated from his wife of more than 19 years, Kathryn Harrold.</p><p class=align-left>Tamron and Lawrence were spotted many times outside the confines of their working environment. They tried as much as possible to keep things as private as possible.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1cd134c43c6ba9c4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Katie Holmes: Tom Cruise divorce story, dating, children, wedding</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2016, a story about Tamron and O'Donnell secretly marrying broke the internet. But, like their relationship, none of the parties concerned ever came out to address the issue. It would have been Tamron's first marriage and Lawrence's second if it ever happened.</p><p class=align-left>Maybe the marriage rumours came up from fans who were quite eager to see them <a href=#>getting married</a>. At the time, Twitter was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">full of comments</a>, with people wanting Tamron and Lawrence to tie the knot.</p><p class=align-left>However, things did not work out between Tamron Hall and Lawrence O'Donnell if they were ever in a relationship. They allegedly separated.</p><p class=align-left>Things became clear when Tamron opened up about <a href=#>having a relationship</a> with another person in 2017. She mentioned that it was a person from the entertainment industry, and fans started to wonder who the lucky person was.</p><h2>Who is Tamron Hall currently married to?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/791b836014a114c8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is actor Billy Burke's wife?

He is the Head of Music Talent at Primary Wave Entertainment. Steve has worked with prominent personalities in the entertainment industry, including Fantasia Barrino and Bernie Mac.</p><p class=align-left>He likely <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started dating</a> Tamron Hall after exiting MSNBC in 2017. While guest co-hosting <i>Live With Kelly and Ryan</i> in 2019, Tamron revealed that she knew Greener for about four years before tying the knot.</p><p class=align-left>They would run into each other often, but their encounter at a pool in Los Angeles got them talking.

Then he lost the key to the house. So it's a crazy story. But yeah, basically, we hid it. It was like a special comedy, and my mother said later that she always knew. She said, 'I always knew he lived there.'<h2>Is Lawrence O’Donnell in a relationship?</h2><p class=align-left>Who is Lawrence O Donnell’s wife? Lawrence was married to Kathryn Harrold from 1994 to 2013. The couple has one child together, Elizabeth Buckley Harrold O'Donnell.</p><p class=align-left>Although there were rumours of Lawrence marrying Tamron Hall, they have never confirmed the matter.

However, neither of them ever confirmed the dating rumours.</p><p class=align-left>Tamron Hall and Lawrence O’Donnell were rumoured to be dating for a long time. They were spotted in public on multiple occasions, but they never confirmed the dating rumours despite this. And it seems they went their separate ways without people finding out the true story.
