Some celebrities love acknowledging their relationship publically, while some celebrities prefer privacy; keeping the relationship under the wraps. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The Twilight Star, Elizabeth Reaser has garnered enough fame; that has raised immense curiosity among the fans&nbsp;regarding her love life. Let's take a sneak peek at Elizabeth's personal life to find if she is married or dating a boyfriend, or is too busy to handle a relationship.</p><h2>Is Elizabeth Reaser Dating Her Boyfriend or A Married Woman?</h2><p>Elizabeth Reaser’s dating life remains a big mystery for all her fans, as least information has circulated the media regarding the matter.</p><p>However, as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>, Elizabeth was in a romantic relationship with writer director, Gavin Wiesen in June 2011. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Elizabeth and her rumored boyfriend Gavin were spotted for the first time at the Cinema Society party for Elizabeth's movie “The Art of Getting By," which was written and directed by Gavin. However, the rumor subsided because neither Elizabeth nor Gavin came forth with the confirmation.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a>'s Magazine even published an image later that year, affirming Elizabeth to be single. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Caption: Elizabeth Reaser with&nbsp;Gavin Wiesen at the screen of&nbsp;“The Art of Getting By" in Beverly Hills on June 2011.</strong></p><p>Photo Credit: Getty Images <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Elizabeth has successfully maintained a tight guard over her love life. Thus it remains unclear if she is indulged in a relationship. But she might&nbsp;be waiting for her Prince Charming to make him her husband. Who knows?</p><p>Elizabeth is known as Cullen matriarch Esme from the Twilight series, and when asked how similar or different she is from her character, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>No, I feel like I'm nothing like my character. It's interesting to me that I get cast as mothers and really maternal, sweet, nice people. ... Maybe I have a vulnerability or something; maybe that's what it is. But other than that, I don't relate to this type of character. She's so good and lovely, and it definitely makes me [a better person]. When I'm working, and I'm always trying to see people in their best light, it makes me a more generous person to play Esme, because I don't feel that. It's funny, but I think Bryce — who is playing Victoria,&nbsp;Bryce Dallas Howard&nbsp;— is the nicest, most amazing woman, and I feel like she should play Esme. I feel like she is Esme. She's so lovely and beautiful and kind and good. I nominate her to play Esme Cullen.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Vampires are the most worn costume during Halloween, and her excitement was evident when she was asked about her reaction if she saw someone dressed up as her onscreen character, Esme Cullen from Twilight.</p><p>Wow, I would love to see someone dressed up as Esme. I think that would be so cool. It would definitely be a career highlight for me; I would love to see someone do that.</p><p>Elizabeth has further portrayed various characters with conviction and following which, she was listed as the hottest on-screen lesbians by IMDB. Elizabeth gave one of the memorable performances in her career with the role of a lesbian author, Allegra in the romantic comedy movie, Puccini for Beginners.</p><h2>Elizabeth Reaser’s Wiki-Like Bio:</h2><p>Elizabeth Reaser was born as Elizabeth Ann Reaser on June 15, 1957, in Bloomfield of Michigan to her parents Karen Wiedman and John Reaser.

She joined Oakland University of Rochester Hills, Michigan, but after a year, she thought of leaving for mid-west to expand the horizons.</p><p>With the support of her parents, Elizabeth applied to The Julliard School in the drama division and was accepted.
