You want to look current but be true to your personal style at the same time. You’ve got questions, we’ve got answers.</span></p><p>Plenty of our favorite designers and brands have provided us with ideas for men’s clothing to shop for fall 2023, be it through fashion show runways, targeted advertising campaigns, or social media posts. We quickly learned there’s no one defining style for 2023 in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>menswear world</a>, but there are plenty of ways to amp up your wardrobe in a unique way — and that goes for fans of athleisure, Western wear, and workwear, too.</p><p>A few things to note: supersized silhouettes are making going-out wear as comfortable as joggers, and we’re loving the resurgence of ’80s and ’90s pieces, which many brands are bringing back for more fun the second time around.</p><p><span>If you’re in the mood to add to your wardrobe and <a rel=noopener href=#>shop the top men’s trends</a> for fall 2023, simply consult our guide. Without further ado, these are the best men’s fashion trends we’re loving right now.</span></p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.3650793650794><h2>Start With a Statement</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rowing-Blazers.jpg><p>As we always say, if it’s good enough for Ryan Reynolds, it’s good enough for us. Early in October, the Deadpool actor was spotted hanging with his wife, Blake Lively, and their pal Hugh Jackman and his outfit has lived in our mind since. We couldn’t help but notice that, paired with his green pants and beanie, the star was <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>rocking a statement graphic sweater</a>. Instantly, we added the style to our must-have list, promising ourselves to shop something similar soon.</p><p>While the actor chose a knit with a bit of…Kenergy (it had a horse on it), this is where you can really get personal. We seen everything from hearts to animals while browsing what’s out there, but ultimately, you can’t go wrong with this classic floral design from the beloved brand Rowing Blazers.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.1904127829561><h2>Say Something</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Retired-Hat.jpg><p>Sometimes, a conversation piece comes in the form of a sleek suit or a colorful, knit scarf. Other days, it’s just a silly little cap with text that makes you and those around you laugh. In 2023, the statement baseball cap has been having a major moment, and in this case, it seems like the more absurd the saying, the better (although, you might want to keep it PG in public settings).</p><p>Looking at all the options out there, it can be a tough choice between old school song lyrics and simple little sayings like “Have a Nice Day.” Ultimately, though, we’re drawn to this hat that says “Retired,” which is both motivational and funny for those who aren’t.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.5086119554205><h2>The Leather Look</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ASOS-Pants.jpg><p>You know who never goes out of style? Travis Kelce — just ask Taylor Swift. Jokes aside, the Kansas City Chiefs’ tight end has always been known for his enviable outfits, and while many have been paying attention to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Swift’s heart pendants</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>mesh tops</a>, we’re also looking at Kelce’s plaid shirts and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">leather pants</a>.</p><p>Sure, leather pants can be a tad divisive — you’re either into to the look or you’re not. But while the style definitely isn’t for the faint of heart, if you’re bored of swapping out jeans for trousers and then jeans again, it doesn’t hurt to experiment, and the warmth factor will surely come in handy during the wintertime.</p><p>To keep the pressure off, we say test the waters with a more affordable faux pair, like this skinny option from ASOS. Technically, they’re labeled as sweatpants, so you’ll also feel comfortable all day long.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.4117174959872><h2>Go West(ern)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tecovas.jpg><p>Perhaps it’s the Yellowstone effect, but it’s impossible to miss the Western influence in men’s fashion these days. Rather than reaching for cowboy hats and chaps, there are a few subtle ways to get the look. We’re fans of embroidered shirts that feature pointed yokes and believe that belts with big buckles add flair to the average pair of pants.</p><p>Another small switch you can make is swapping out your Chelsea boots for a Western boot. To keep things from feeling too much like a costume, try a sleek suede pair instead of regular leather.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.4514767932489><h2><b>Just Relax</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BQ477_WZ3187_d2.jpeg><p><span>The past decade-plus has brought about a sea change in men’s suiting. If you kept an eye out, you often came across razor-sharp, super-slim suits everywhere from Thom Browne to J.Crew.</span></p><p><span>Now, things are loosening up ever-so-slightly in menswear design — think blazers with more room to move</span>, <span>similar to old-school suits of the ’40s and ’50s where silhouettes were relaxed without being baggy or sloppy.</span></p><p>This <a href=# rel=nofollow>plaid jacket</a> gives a traditional blazer a preppy twist. Don’t be afraid to size up and layer it over a denim shirt, a turtleneck, or sweater, then complete your look with jeans and dress shoes.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.2557666214383><h2>Hello Houndstooth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Mango-Coat.jpg><p>Considering the snowy season is more about practicality than looking cool, it’s possible you’ve already got your winter coat covered. Oversized puffers are great for fighting off that feel-it-in-your-bones kind of chill, but on those days when you’re sweating in that thing, an overcoat is a smart choice.</p><p>For fall 2023, we’re gravitating toward all things houndstooth. The timeless print is exactly that — timeless — and there’s something so sharp about styling this layer over trousers and sweater. Slip this wool Mango option on before you head to those holiday gatherings and honestly, the compliments are bound to roll in (especially from your elders).</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.616><h2><strong>What’s Old Is New</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Everlane-Chinos.jpeg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$81</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>108</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>25% Off</span></p><p>We’ll never knock a pair of jeans and believe no wardrobe is complete without some structured trousers, but if you’re looking for in-between alternative, it’s worth adding a pair of chinos to the mix. The lightweight, slightly fitted pants style is a timeless pick that works for both casual days and ones spent at the office, and look just as great with a plain old T-shirt as they do with a button-up.</p><p>To nail the look for 2023, think relaxed but not baggy — take your proper pant size and add footwear that delivers some bulk (chunky loafers, combat boots, thick-soled sneakers, etc.). The good news is that chinos never really go out of style, so if you invest in a pair now, you’ll probably be rocking them for the next few years (and beyond).</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.287037037037><h2><b>Retro Reigns Supreme</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Abercrombie-Fleece.jpg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$<strong>93.50</strong></span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$110</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>15% Off</span></p><p><span>Fashion is cyclical, often to the extreme, and if it’s jarring to think about styles from the ‘90s being mined for trend inspiration, join the club. Big-name long-running brands like <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>L.L. Bean</a> — a company as popular now as it’s ever been – welcomed back the 1990s with </span><a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#><span>archive collections</span></a><span> last year, and those throwback styles aren’t going anywhere any time soon.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For Fall 2023, be on the lookout for color-blocked designs in vivid shades, featured on everything from outerwear to sportswear. Logos are also back in a big way, and in this case, the more visible, the better.&nbsp;</span></p><p>If bright stripes and statement-making windbreakers aren’t exactly your thing, you can still nail the look in a subtle way with a printed fleece.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.256038647343><h2><b>Hop into Hybrid</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cole-Haan-Shoes.jpg><h2 class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-title-lg data-transform data-truncate>Cole Haan Men’s 5.ZERØGRAND WRK Chukka Boot</h2><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$248</span></p><p><span>Once upon a time, shoes were separated into easily identifiable categories: dress shoes, work boots, athletic sneakers, casual sneakers, etc. But in recent years, something in the menswear tides shifted</span>, and in 2023, <span>our favorite shoe styles are still being mashed up in increasingly impressive ways.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Call them “sneaker boots” or “hybrid shoes,” but between Cole Haan infusing </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#><span>dress shoes with athletic technology</span></a><span> </span>and high-fashion brands like <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Loewe collaborating with On</a>, pulling double duty seems to be all the rage these days. Sure, you should still keep the classics in rotation, but it doesn’t hurt to have some hybrid shoes on hand for punching up joggers or your favorite pair of jeans.</p><p>Cole Haan’s sporty sneaker-meets-boot-meets-dress-shoe design is perhaps one of the coolest examples of this trend. They’ll work for the office, walking the dog, and just about any weekend adventure you can think of.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.8929384965831><h2><b>Performance Meets Style</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lululemon-Pants.jpg><p>During the pandemic,<span> casual performance menswear </span>became a regular part of our rotation. Afterwards, it proved it was here to stay. Crewneck sweatshirts and stretchy merino tees are a mainstay in our wardrobe these days, while drawstring waistbands and joggers have replaced stiff materials.</p><p><span>Mainstream brands like </span><a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#><span>Public Rec</span></a><span> and upscale trendsetters like the famed </span><a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#><span>John Elliott</span></a><span> are taking athleticwear beyond the gym in a big way. Yet, thanks to sleek, tailored designs, no one even know that your daytime clothes are as comfortable as pajamas.</span></p><p>While many know Lululemon as one of the best places to buy workout gear, did you know it’s also one of the best places to buy everyday pants? <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>This pair</a> of wide-leg pants are guaranteed to be durable and comfortable.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.2161290322581><h2><b>Polished Polos</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Banana-Republic-Polo.jpg><p><span>While some trends are more pervasive, taking over entire categories of menswear, others are a bit more niche. Take the polo, for instance. Once a classically preppy item available in bright colors and often featuring a chest logo, 2023’s polo trend feels bit more polished.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The polo is leveling up in a way that harkens back to the ’50s or ’60s: draped knit options that offer a touch more warmth on breezy nights. Embroidered and printed designs that feel both sharp enough for the office and ritzy enough for a night on the town.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This accented option from Banana Republic feels like something our grandparents would approve of, and honestly, we’re here for it.</span></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.1824480369515><h2><b>Get Down to Business</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Quince-Chore-Coat.jpg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$59.99</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>138</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>57% Off</span></p><p><span>The term workwear was once a catch-all for clothing you could actually wear to get down to real, rough-and-tumble work – denim was the original “workwear” fabric, found in chore coats and five-pocket pants worn first largely in France before coming to the U.S. Now, plenty of brands are turning workwear into a hybrid between tailoring and well, actual old-school workwear.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Workwear styles of today are casually cool and rugged, with enough easygoing appeal to keep you comfortable in breezy weather and enough room for layering to handle cold temperatures. It’s time to add few styles to your wardrobe and get to “work” right now.</p><p>That means your blazer might actually look more like a chore coat, just like this pick from Quince.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.3682051282051><h2><b>Fashion’s Front Lines</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Todd-Snyder-Sunglasses.jpg><p><span>There are some trends that tend to ebb and flow, but never quite leave the menswear world — they blend the classic and modern with a sort of timeless, rugged appeal. The military, for instance, has long been a source of both inspiration and real-world practicality for fashion designers and the general public.</span></p><p><span>A few examples that have stood the test of time? The chino, aviator sunglasses and the white tee, all of which were standard-issue items for soldiers before they were worn by the public at large.</span></p><p>Aside from working green and camo into your outfits, you can follow the military trend the 2023 way with sunglasses. Randolph Engineering, the brand that was first contracted to make aviator sunglasses for the military, collaborated with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>American fashion designer Todd Snyder</a> on a cool collection of frames that will have you looking straight out of Top Gun.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.5321992709599><h2><b>Back to… the Future</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-02-at-9.40.37-PM.png><p><span>No, you didn’t just hop out of your DeLorean outfitted with a flux capacitor — the ‘80s have been fully revived, especially in the world of men’s jeans. You can skip layering your denim jacket with a red vest a la Marty McFly, but instead, look for a distinct throwback cut to add to your closet.</span></p><p><span>Slim or slim-straight fits are going to be flattering on plenty of guys when it comes to stylish jeans, but just like chinos and blazers, things are loosening up ever so slightly — and the wash of your new denim is going to be a touch on the lighter side, too.</span></p><p><span>Take Levi’s athletic taper fit light wash jean: it’s looser without being overly baggy, and the light wash harkens back to the days of yesteryear without overdoing it.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9.9649681528662><h2><b>Plain White Tee</b>s</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Buck-Mason-Tee.jpg><p><span>The white tee was once primarily worn as an undershirt and seldom seen on the big screen or in public — until actors like Marlon Brando and James Dean paired it with dark jeans and leather jackets, changing the archetype of men’s style forever. Yes, that’s lofty praise, but those looks made an impact for a reason: it was slightly rugged, a touch edgy and just plain, well, cool.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The white T-shirt has been redone in major ways in recent years, so much so that you can actually wear a white (or off-white tee) on its own without looking like you’ve just rolled out of bed. Brands like Buck Mason are even making the style feel luxe</span> (probably because billionaires are big fans of these shirts, too).</p><p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Buck Mason Pima Curved Hem Tee</a>, for instance, boasts the company’s signature curved hem, a flattering detail that takes the tee from undershirt territory into a style you can wear on its own. Plus, a range of dusty colors and soft fabric means the standard tee has more variety than in days gone by.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratforKvv4yfmKygmaS7bsDRnqWdq11nfXN%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./489745-all-aiden-onfroy-late-xxxtentacions-brother.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All to know about Aiden Onfroy, the late XXXTentacion's brother">&larr;
