Her mother,<strong> Jayne Mansfield</strong>, was one of the first blonde bombshells to take over the big screen, while her father, <strong>Mickey Hargitay</strong>, parlayed his fame as a former Mr. Universe into a successful acting career. The couple had married in 1958 and welcomed three children: sons <strong>Miklós </strong>and <strong>Zoltán</strong>, and daughter Mariska. In 1963, they divorced and quickly reconciled, only to officially split a year later.

He eventually made his way to America and settled down in Cleveland, Ohio where his bodybuilding dreams began to take shape. “Mickey trained hard throughout the ’50s, winning several local “body beautiful” competitions,” per the outlet. By 1955, Mickey was ready to take the title of Mr. Universe.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The bodybuilder’s championship inspired a generation to take up the sport. “Bodybuilding was dominated by American champions; there was no hope for anyone else,” <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;told the&nbsp;L.A. Times</a>. “That someone from central Europe became Mr. Universe gave hope for someone like myself and others to dream about.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Back in those days, bodybuilding was thought of as a freakish, unusual activity that wasn’t popular with the general public,” <strong>Gene Mozee</strong>, a bodybuilding historian, told the outlet. “At that time, athletic coaches discouraged lifting weights, thinking you’d become muscle bound. And along came Mickey Hargitay, a great all-around athlete.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Mickey then found work as a muscleman in Mae West’s nightclub act, the Mae West Revue, in 1956. According to the L.A. Times, Jayne caught the act in a New York club and when she was&nbsp;asked what she would like that evening, she reportedly responded: “I’ll have a steak and the man on the left!”&nbsp; Mickey and Jayne would marry two years later.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The couple would go on to work together in films like The Loves of Hercules, Promises! Promises! and Primitive Love.&nbsp; “I enjoyed my career,” Mickey once said, per the outlet. “I never wanted to be any more than what I was, and I had fun doing it.” He died at the age of 80 on September 14, 2006, from multiple myeloma.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I’ll take inspiration and information from wherever I can get it, whether that’s from my character, from my husband, or from my dad, who always said, ‘Mariska, you can learn from anyone and everyone,’” Mariska told <a class=link href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-ylk="slk:Good Housekeeping;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p=43 data-v9y=1 data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Good Housekeeping</a> in 2012. The actress also has half-sister, <strong>Tina, </strong>from her dad’s relationship with <strong>Mary Birge</strong>.</p><h2>Jayne Mansfield</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Jayne was a mid-western girl born in Pennsylvania on April 19, 1933. After finding fame with Playboy photo shoots, Jayne soon became a sex symbol on the big screen as well with films like <i>The Girl Can’t Help It</i> (1956),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i> (1957) and <i>Too Hot to Handle</i> (1960).</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>As for the incredible fame that followed and fans clamoring to know more about her, Jayne appeared grounded about all of it. In a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>1960 interview</a>, Jayne explained, “I feel like a star owes it to her public to bring the public into her life because the fans feel like they own you and if you kept your life a complete secret it wouldn’t be fair to them. But my private life, and when I say private life I mean my private life, will always be private.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Her romance with Mickey appeared to be an on-again/off-again one. In 1963, Jayne attended a five-minute divorce hearing with Mickey in a Mexico court, per the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LA Times</a>. The divorce was ruled invalid in California. After a brief reconciliation and a subsequent split, Jayne&nbsp;sued for the Mexican divorce to be recognized, winning in 1964.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>In 1967, Jayne was killed in a car crash along with her boyfriend and their driver. Mariska and her brothers were also in the car at the time, but survived. Mariska was just three years old at the time, and Jayne was 34.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>On April 20, 2023, Mariska took to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> on what would have been <strong>Jayne</strong>&nbsp;90th birthday to remember her with a heartfelt message, which <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>you can SEE HERE</a>. Mariska also has a half-sister named <strong>Jayne</strong> from her mom’s relationship with <strong>Paul Mansfield </strong>and a half-brother named Tony from her mom’s relationship with <strong>Matt Climber</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yaqaKrm5Z6qa3RoKCtmalivaK%2BxKerrGVlZYR6fphrZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./meg-ryan-black-fall-dress-oufit-8383894.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meg Ryans No-Fail 2-Piece Outfit Oozes Witchy Vibes">&larr;
