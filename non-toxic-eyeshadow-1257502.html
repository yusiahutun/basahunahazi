These factors are listed below:</p><p><strong>1. Check Ingredient List</strong></p><p>One of the most important factors to consider before buying the best non-toxic eyeshadow is ensuring it doesn’t expose your eyes to a lot of chemicals.</p><p>Our contributor Ghanima Abdullah, an experienced cosmetologist and beauty consultant, says, “Fragrance, talk and glitter are ingredients to stay clear of in eyeshadow. "Fragrance" is composed of undisclosed chemicals that are frequently allergens. Talc is frequently contaminated with asbestos, a carcinogen, and glitter is made of microplastics which are not great for our life in our waterways.”</p><p>The area around your eyes is quite delicate, and any harsh additive can trigger an unpleasant reaction. It’s better to steer clear of eyeshadows that hurt your eyes. Zuzu Luxe Mineral Eyeshadow is an excellent pick to protect your eyes while adding glam and glitz to your looks.</p><p><strong>2. Assess the Texture</strong></p><p>Another important factor to consider before buying the eyeshadow is its texture. You can create unique looks if the eyeshadow blends nicely and features a blendable formula. If it doesn’t blend nicely, it may look rough and cakey, and that’s the last thing you want. Revlon Eyeshadow Palette is a perfect pick to get the best blendability.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Assess Your Eye Color</strong></p><p>Choose an eyeshadow color that complements your eye color. People with brown eyes can go for warm shades like bronze, whereas those with dark eyes can choose shades of silver or black that look bold. Pink, brown, and gold shades look good on people with hazel eyes. Those with green eyes can choose vibrant shades like brown or pink to create a dramatic look. Likewise, if you have gray eyes, you can try silver shades.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Use a Non-toxic Eyeshadow?</h2></p><p>Step 1: Wipe your eyelids with a soft cloth to ensure they are clean.</p><p>Step 2: Choose the shades for eyelid and highlighting.</p><p>Step 3: Apply the highlight shade on your brow bone in an outward direction lightly.</p><p>Step 4: Follow it up by covering your eyelids. Use a flat brush for even blending.</p><p>Step 5: Go for a slightly dark shade to cover the crease.</p><p>Step 6: Use eyeliner or mascara to complete the look.</p><p><strong>Contributor:&nbsp;</strong>Ghanima Abdullah, Cosmetologist, <a href=#>The Right Hairstyles</a></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Slaying bold and vivid looks is easier when your eye makeup is on fleek. The composition of eye makeup may be quite confusing as eyes are highly susceptible to allergies and infections. You need blendable and gentle formulas that these non-toxic eyeshadows feature efficiently. The range of colors of these palettes keeps your worries of creating distinct makeup looks at bay. The antioxidant-rich formula of Julep Eyeshadow 101 Crème to Powder Waterproof Eyeshadow Stick may come as a surprise with its nourishing properties. So, get your set of makeup brushes and stay on top of your style game.</p><h2 class=title>FAQ's</h2><p>What is the key ingredient used to make eyeshadow?</p><p>Talc or mica is the key ingredient used to make eyeshadow.</p><p>Are all eyeshadows made with talc?</p><p>No, some are also made with mica or kaolin clay.</p><p>How long does natural powder eyeshadow stay?</p><p>It depends on the ingredients and formulations. However, it may stay up to 4-5 hours.</p><h2 class=title>Why Trust Pinkvilla</h2><p>Sayantani, our in-house makeup specialist, believes eyeshadows are the best way to spice up dull and monotonous looks.
