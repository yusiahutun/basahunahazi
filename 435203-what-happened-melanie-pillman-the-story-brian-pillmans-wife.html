The athlete was born in 1962, in Norwood Ohio. The details of his parents, siblings and bringing remain a mystery. However, his father passed away while Pillman was only a young boy.</p><p class=align-left>Additionally, Brian suffered health challenges since he was three years old. First, the wrestler was diagnosed with throat cancer and endured over 30 surgeries to overcome the issue. Eventually, he recovered completely but had to live with a raspy voice for the rest of his life.</p><p class=align-left>Pillman joined Norwood High School, where he joined the <a href=#>football</a> team and became a star player. He later proceeded to Miami University, where his prowess in the game continued to grow. As expected, Brian started his career as <a href=#>a footballer</a> and joined Begnal's in 1984 and later, the Calgary Stampeders.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/63a99ed75b32af00.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bryan Callen: divorce story, wife, net worth, latest updates</span></p></a><h3>Career</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4ddc757f368bc85a.jpg><p class=align-left>Despite suffering <a id=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/453836-brian-pillman-looking-through-the-eyes-of-the-loose-cannon href=# rel="nofollow noopener">numerous injuries</a> in the field, Pillman enjoyed a thriving football career. One of his former coaches advised him to join the wrestling <a href=#>world</a>, and he trained under Stu Hart. Brian had an impressive performance and joined crews like''Bad Company.'' Pillman joined WWF in 1996.</p><p class=align-left>Pillman got involved in a car accident that saw him break an ankle and dislocate a jaw in the same year. Unfortunately, the athlete reportedly started abusing painkillers and also started using cocaine and alcohol excessively. Additionally, Brian also used Human Growth Hormone pills to maintain his body shape.</p><p class=align-left>Pillman's condition deteriorated, and he passed away in a hotel room in Bloomington in October 1997. According to the medical report, the cause of death was coronary artery disease. He left behind his wife, Melanie, and six children.

The wrestler's wife was Melanie Pillman, born in September 1965. The two got married in 1993. The details of her upbringing remain under wraps.</p><p class=align-left>So, was Melanie Pillman a model? No, Melanie worked as an accounts receivable clerk for her father-in-lawâ€™s Kentucky trucking company.

According to Brittany, Pillman's sister, Linda, always came to their rescue because they often went without food or decent clothing.
