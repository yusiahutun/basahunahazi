And, the best sweet perfumes take the spotlight when it comes to feeling your best on special occasions with your sweetheart, such as a fancy dinner or a party. While these fragrances have had a bad reputation of merely being ‘sweet’ and transporting you to unpleasant childhood memories of body mists and sprays that smelled like candy, apples, and sugary vanilla, with their rich, gourmand, and balsamic accords, they now seem to add nuance to your aura. They are often elusive and mysterious — meaning they always leave one craving for more, which makes these perfumes excellent aphrodisiacs!&nbsp;</p><p>Our contributor Tabatha Farnel, Founder of Aroma Authority, a fragrance brand, says, “Vanilla and tonka bean are some of the most common notes in sweet-smelling perfumes. Other popular sweet notes include honey, dates, caramel, chocolate, marshmallow, cotton candy, cream, and fruits.”</p><p>When blended with other green, spicy, or aquatic accords, sweet perfumes can be a great choice for several other occasions, such as a casual day out with friends, a family get-together, corporate events, proms, galas, etc. Some creamy and lactonic fragrances are perfect for spending some me-time and snuggling up in bed. In addition, sweet perfumes are usually the preferred choice for young girls and teenagers over musky or <a href=#><u>spicy fragrances</u></a>. The essence here is that once your senses start to get bored with everyday scents, you can delight them by spritzing some sweetness in the air!&nbsp;</p><p>Our contributor Tabatha Farnel shares, “Sweet smelling perfumes can be masculine too! A common note in sweet fragrances for men is vanilla. Vanilla is often combined with other notes, creating a wide variety of sweet fragrances for men, such as sweet fruity fragrances with cherry or citrus, sweet and warm spicy fragrances with tobacco, cinnamon, or cardamom, or sweet and fresh fragrances with lavender, mint, and juniper.”</p><p>Sweet scents may seem too icky or juvenile for some, which is why many adults avoid using them. Also, cheap-quality concoctions that are loaded with alcohol can be quite nauseating and may even trigger allergies in some scent-sensitive folks. However, the right blend of notes can rejuvenate your senses and make you feel amazing without coming off as too cloying. To help you get a good sweet-smelling perfume to suit your taste, we have curated a list of our highly-recommended products.

However, knowing that you like sweet-smelling perfumes may not be enough, because while some accords may appeal to you, others may not. There are a few sweet accords to consider before making a purchase:</p><p><strong>Fruit Accords:</strong> Notes of bergamot, grapefruit, apples, peaches, pears, apricots, raspberry, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Lactonic Accords: </strong>Smooth notes of whipped cream, vanilla, coconut, shea butter, etc.</p><p><strong>Gourmand Accords:</strong> Rich, delicious-smelling notes of chocolate, caramel, sparkling wine, candy, tonka beans, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Floral Accords:</strong> Notes of jasmine, waterlily, lavender, pink rose, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>If any of the above-mentioned accords seem appealing to you, then consider buying a perfume that contains it. This way, you will not regret your perfume choice after some time or find it too cloying.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Consider the Base Notes:</strong> With sweet-smelling perfumes, chances are that the fruity and balsamic notes of the fragrance will wear out soon, leaving only the base notes of the perfume. Hence, always consider the smell that sticks around at the end before making a purchase. If you like intense woody scents that add mystery to your personality, then look for end notes of cedarwood, patchouli, vetiver, sandalwood, etc. If you want something to neutralize the “ick factor” in your perfume, then musk, amber, and leather can be incredible ingredients to look for. And if you’re one of those who just cannot get enough of the sweet goodness of your perfume, then notes of vanilla, caramel, and chocolate go a long way!</p><p><strong>Consider the Occasion to Wear:</strong> While sweet-smelling perfumes are best suited for romantic occasions such as date nights, honeymoons, luxury camping, etc., one can also wear them to other occasions depending on the ingredients infused in them. For instance, a linear vanilla fragrance can work well for casual, everyday settings. Oriental or spicy accords may be appropriate for traditional events and family get-togethers. And, mild floral or herbaceous accords would be ideal to last the work day.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Consider the Season: </strong>With a change in seasons, arises the need for changing your signature scent. Whether warm and seductive or fresh and fruity, every season has its iconic notes and scents, which when worn, do wonders for your mood and personality. Here is a breakdown of which notes are best for different seasons.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Spring - Peonies, orchids, and cherry blossom</li><li>Summer - Citrus, bergamot, and lemon</li><li>Fall - Musk, sandalwood, and vanilla</li><li>Winter - Amber, cinnamon, musk, honey, and cotton candy</li></ul><p><strong>Think About Longevity: </strong>When looking for the best sweet-smelling perfume, make sure to check for its longevity. EDPs last much longer than EDTs and mists, so choose accordingly. Also, as a thumb rule, perfumes last somewhere between 6 to 18 months.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Avoid Overwhelming Scents: </strong>For those who are sensitive to smell, it is important to check for the fragrances they are investing in. Also, perform patch tests for allergic reactions or irritation before purchasing the full-size bottle.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Make Your Perfume Last Longer?</h2></p><p>To make your perfume last long, keep in mind the following tips -&nbsp;</p><p>- Spray perfume on your damp skin.</p><p>- Keep your skin moisturized to make the perfume's scent last longer.</p><p>- Apply petroleum jelly on your wrist before applying perfume.</p><p>- Spritz perfume directly on your pulse points.</p><p>- Apply perfume to your clothes.</p><p>- Use EDP or eau de parfums.</p><p><strong>Contributor:&nbsp;</strong>Tabatha Farnel, Founder of <a href=#>Aroma Authority</a></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>So there you have it.
