Joe got the tattoo of the renowned Japanese samurai after reading <i>The Book of Five Rings</i> at the age of 16.</p><p class=align-left>During one of his podcast sessions on his show, Joe spoke about the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">inspiration behind the forearm</a> tattoo that extends towards his elbow.</p>My right arm, I have a tattoo of Miyamoto Musashi because I read a quote when I was 16 years old and doing martial arts... I read The Book of Five Rings, and he wrote this book, which is a book on strategy. Miyamoto Musashi was a samurai who killed 62 men in one-on-one combat and wrote this book about it.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/749a7d46d40a531e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Sam Richardson's wife now?

The tattoo is completely different from the one on the right arm as it has a spiritual significance.</p><p class=align-left>The artwork is a godly figure on the top with its third eye open. A snake is coming from the top towards the arm's entire length. The <a href=#>whole tattoo</a> looks like Lord Siva from Hindu mythology.</p><p class=align-left>And that is not all about the tattoo. A chemical structure of a particular chemical compound is engraved between the religious figure.
